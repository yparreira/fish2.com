<h1>Of Wines, Cats, and Sailing Ships</h1>

<h4>Toyz first</h4>

A data toy to explore words and wines... you start with a wine, click, then it goes
to the words that are most commonly used to describe it, then you may click on a
word, and you get the wines that are described using that wine, etc., etc.

<p>

<a href="/words">Wines, words, and no songs</a>

<p>
<h4>Individual wine clouds</h4>
<p>

All sorts of clouds for all sorts of wines. Well, actually, the
same sorts of clouds.

<h4>Comparative matrices, grids, whatever</h4>
<p>

Here are some comparisons I made between various wines, with different
styles, formats, etc., as I played around with the data. Unfortunately
the data from the Wine Advocate (aka Robert Parker and crew) were lost
in the great disk crash of ought-something (it's a paid subscription, so
you have to fork over the pesos to get at anything.) The Wine Enthusiast
had more reviews (I think over 100K when I ran my gathering tests), but
I (perhaps snobbishly so? :)) feel the reviews weren't as high quality,
but still very good for the task at hand.

<p>

More heat-mappy kinds of maps, for white and reds, from the enthusiast;
perhaps some of the more attractive grids, with mouseovers and such.

<p>

<a href="whitez.html">Whites</a>

<p>

A comparison of the top 10 adjectives and nouns used (minus some filtered) from the 
Wine Advocate (all reviewers) for various wines.

Same thing... but for top 20 adjectives and nouns.
