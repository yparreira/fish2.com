Go to the options...helpers dialog, pick "application/x-perl", and
delete the ".pl" suffix.  In my version of Netscape at least deleting
the whole "application/x-perl" entry doesn't seem to do the trick
(hardwired defaults?), but the above does as the browser will no
longer assume that anything with a ".pl" extension is an
"application/x-perl".
