<h3>Beginnings & The purpose of the Survey</h3>
<IMG SRC="thin_rainbow_line.gif">
<p>

What comes to mind when thinking of banks?  Money, security, trust?
Federal agencies may be corrupt, but we generally perceive them to be
vulnerable only from the inside - no one can steal from the FBI and get away
with it.  A congresswoman might take bribes, but crooks won't
break into her office and steal important documents.  Newspapers might
show us only the news that <strong>they</strong> see fit to print, but at 
least we
can trust that the headline is what they intended to publish.  We 
routinely
give our credit card numbers to restaurants, mail-order companies, 
hotel reservationists, etc.,
without giving it a second thought.

<p>

The list goes on, but the fact remains: there are many organizations and
social institutions that we take for granted as being trustworthy.  We
may love them, we may curse them, but they are all part of the social
and cultural fabric that makes our lives bearable by their
dependability; our social security is less in a government trust fund
than in the social constructs that we create in our daily lives.  
Can we reasonably expect the WWW to support this web of trust in the
virtual domain as well?


<p>

Perhaps naturally, as the phenomenon known as the World Wide Web
(aka the WWW, or simply, "the Web") has touched more and more people, these
social constructs were among the first major non-computer specific
organizations to make their presence felt.  You can now hear the
president's cat
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/Family/audio/socks.au">Socks</a>,
tour the 
<a href="http://www.paris.org./Musees/Louvre/">Louvre</a>,
and read the 
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> without leaving the 
relative safety of your keyboard.  Joy (well, ok, I must admit I liked
hearing Socks meow, and my cats are now convinced I'm hiding another kitty in 
the computer.)

<p>

As important or as mundane as the WWW can be, however, I'm
enthralled by culture and the Internet.  The fact that such agencies
as the CIA and DOJ and other really significant organizations can be
broken into is really fascinating; what's equally interesting to me
is the lack of accountability in this sort of activity.  What most
people don't
seem to understand is that with individual instances of computer crime 
<a href="footies.html#i_b_i">on the Internet</a> (e.g. breaking into the CIA)
there is almost no chance that the perpetrator(s) will ever be found or 
caught, unless they talk to people about their exploits.  Computer crimes
(perhaps all crimes?) are usually solved by extreme carelessness, sheer 
stupidity, and human factors that are unrelated to the technical aspects 
or merits of the incident.

<p>
Technically speaking it is incredibly difficult to track someone
down.  The reason that Tsutomu Shimomura caught Kevin Mitnick (the last
big "hacker chase") was not because of Tsutomu's awesome technological 
prowess (which he has, in spades), but because his prey kept attacking,
kept repeating his patterns in a rather obsessive vein.  
It was the constant duplication and predictability of the methods used to
compromise computer systems that sunk him.  To put it more plainly -
if the President of the United State's WWW site was either broken
into or taken down
the attackers would <strong>not</strong> be caught.  No matter 
how much effort was put into it.  It would almost be inconceivable
technically, unless they were incredibly unlucky, or, much more
likely, they talked to their pals about the exploit.  Juxtapose this with
someone physically breaking into the White House itself!  Unfortunately for 
the miscreants (fortunately for others, perhaps?), law breakers seem to 
thrive on machismo and bragging to others.

<p>

Technically speaking, it is relatively easy to do a survey of the
security of any number of computer systems on the Internet.  Socially
speaking however, it isn't clear if doing such a thing 
without explicit permission of the systems and sites involved would
be undesirable or otherwise unacceptable behavior.  In
the next section I'll attempt to address these issues, as well as 
tell what sites were chosen and why I chose them for the survey.
