<a name="survey_hosts">"<strong>After doing a security survey
of approximately 1700 of these interesting Web sites
on the Internet (and another 500 as a control study)..."</strong></a>
</blockquote>
I will not release the names of the hosts or the raw data that I
collected.  As a matter of fact, I have sent it off-site and
deleted all traces of it
from my machine; I couldn't access it myself even if wished to.  I 
will arrange to release the data to CERT 
(or perhaps another well-known response team) if they wish to get 
the data under a non-disclosure agreement for research purposes or 
perhaps to warn the sites that are potentially vulnerable.

<blockquote>"<strong>However, there are many ways to detect potential problems

<p>

All of the tests run in this survey could fall into one of two categories:

<ul>
<li> day to day operational results that everyone does on a daily basis.
	This includes such things as sending mail to a remote site
	(this can show the version of sendmail that your recipient
	uses), connecting to a WWW or an anonymous ftp server, etc.
<p>
<li> generally accepted examinitions of an Internet host.  For instance,
	using a remote host's "echo" or "chargen" port for testing
	your own host.
</ul>

I believe that all of the tests I ran are perfectly legal.  In addition,
I would sincerely hope that my good intent and willingness to disclose the 
information to the appropriate agencies/organizations will be of some 
use to me in this matter, should it arise, god forbid.

<a name="single_bug"><strong>"...an additional 9-24% of these same hosts could 
	be broken into if a single new bug were found (or known 
	about by potential intruders) in either of two important and
	widely-used programs, <cite>wu-ftp</cite> and <cite>sendmail</cite>.
	</strong>
</blockquote>

I ran a "what if" simulation using SATAN against the 1700 surveyed
hosts.  A new bug that would effect all versions of sendmail would 
increase the percentage of vulnerable hosts by 8.65%.  A new bug
in wu-ftp version 2.4 would increase the percentage by 23.93%.

<a name="waterlogged"><strong>"And much of the security information that gets
wide-spread popular coverage is so watered down or simply incorrect
as to be almost useless."</strong>
</blockquote>
How many <a href="glossary.html#cdv">Columbus Day Virii</a>
do we need to be alarmed about before we
catch on?  Some of the problem is that most people don't have the technical
ability to discriminate between a real potential problem and a fake one;
the differences are sometimes subtle.  And sometimes false alarms are
essentially indistinguishable from the real thing.  Even if the problem is 
real, it is often marred by translations from writers who don't understand the
technology or issues involved.  For instance,
<a href="http://www.takedown.com">Kevin Mitnick</a> 
was thought to be a super-cracker, someone
who wrote amazing security programs and could break into almost any computer
in the world.  Not!  Java and the WWW are rife with scare tactics and
false alarms.

To put it simply; modern multitasking, multiuser operating systems (like
Unix, NT, and even to a certain degree MacOS and Win95) are incredibly
complex things.  They can do almost anything, and if you connect to
networks there's a potential to get fucked over in a variety of ways;
there is <strong>no</strong> easy path to security.
<a href="appendix_c.html">Here are some very simple strategies to 
follow</a> that might help, but above all, be educated, clever, and 
careful.

<p>  I'm really not trying to scare anyone here; simply because you know
that you can get hit by a bus when crossing the street doesn't mean that
it will happen or that you should live in fear of motorized vehicles
(as if anyone will read this footnote anyway!)  Anyway, here's a 
<a href="v_parody.html">parody of a real virus scare</a> that I found 
amusing.  To quote it: "if this weren't a SERIOUS situation, WE WOULDN'T 
BE DISCUSSING IT IN 'ALL CAPS'."

<a name="i_b_i"><strong>"...is that with individual instances of computer crime
on the Internet (e.g. breaking into the CIA)"</strong></a>
</blockquote>
I say "on the Internet" because other computer crimes are often significantly
different.  The old story about someone getting rich by having the bank
accounting program steal a fraction of a penny from each transaction is
very different, because banks employ very heavy 
<a href="glossary.html#audit_trail">audit trails</a> for accountability 
reasons.  The Internet has almost no digital trail, no electronic path that 
can be followed by pursuers, and what little there is is easily erased
by would-be intruders (directly analogous to sweeping the trail behind
you to obliterate your footsteps.)  By the time you get to where you
suspect the interloper was, all trace is probably gone.

<a name="jls"><strong>"...is perhaps analogous to Jonathan Livingston Seagull
buzz-bombing the elder gulls at speeds exceeding 100 MPH."</strong></a>
</blockquote>
<cite>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</cite> is a wonderful book by Richard Bach.  
In this book seagulls are only interested in eating and their slightly 
bizarre social order (sounds about right.)  The protagonist (Jonathan) 
is a seagull who wants to <cite>fly</cite>.  When he finally
does learn some flying tricks and screams by the feeding grounds at high
speed, the elder gulls banish him from the flock.  A wonderful,
heartwarming and spiritual work.  Highly recommended, along with his
other masterpiece, <cite>Illusions</cite>.

<a name="netcraft"><strong>"The security ramifications of this are
fairly staggering."</strong></a>
</blockquote>

It is amazing how much information you can gather from a remote host
simply by connecting to a service and chatting with it (electronically,
that is!)  You can often tell what sort of system it is and what 
vulnerabilities exist - for instance, if you determine that a system is
running the Apache web server, you can deduce that it is a Unix system,
since the Apache server only runs (currently) on Unix hosts.  Furthermore,
if a CERT advisory warns you about security problems about a version
of sendmail and tells you to run a new version of it, you can
tell if a system is vulnerable or not by connecting to the SMTP
and looking at the version number listed.  Most network
services are very friendly and will give you all sorts of information
if you ask nicely.  This is one of the main methods that SATAN uses
to determine weaknesses in remote systems.

<p>
Netcraft's survey gives intruders a vast database of break-in 
information; you can simply query its database and determine potential 
targets.  Note that it is easy to get this information on any <i>individual</i>
host yourself - most
WWW servers give out the version numbers whenever you talk to them (although
you typically don't see this as a user, the browser guts do.)
And while many people find the Netcraft information useful, interesting, and
provocative, I would still strongly suggest that Netcraft 
remove such information from the publically accessible database.

<a name="lenin"><strong>"
The survey was presumably detected in greater number than this; 
unfortunately there is no way to determine just how frequently it 
was discovered."</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>

After releasing this document, I got the following note from an administrator
who ran the "Lenin Project" machines:

<blockquote>
<i>
Howdy.  I wanted to write and congratulate you on your security survey; it's 
very useful information, though I doubt a lot of the people who should read 
through it are going to.  Interestingly enough, I used to administer one of the 
machines you scanned; one of the few that probed you back during the scan.  
Since I've always had terrible luck complaining to sysadmins about probes, 
I did the next best thing: within 10 minutes of your initial scan, 

<blockquote>
ALL : .trouble.org : DENY
</blockquote>

was in our <i>hosts.deny</i> file and the people in the systems group had mail 
messages telling them to watch for connections from the domain.  I 
have since removed your domain from the file. :)  I am fairly embarassed 
to admit, however, that the machine you scanned probably came up vulnerable 
due to an ancient version of sendmail that should have been upgraded long 
ago.  However, since we decommissioned the machine early this morning, 
I guess it's no longer an issue.
</i>
</blockquote>

(The <i>hosts.deny</i> file refers to the 
<i>TCP wrappers</i>, which can be found on
<a href="ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/security/index.html">Wietse Venema's
ftp site.</a>; putting this entry in the configuration file means that
connections from my machine were to be refused in the future.)

<p>
This was possibly a common response from sites that detected the 
survey but weren't willing to go to the effort of contacting me, my ISP, or
a CERT directly (the TCP wrappers are very popular and easy to use), but
I'll never know just how frequent it was.  The lack of success that this
system administrator had (with her/his reporting security problems to
remote sites) might be the same reason that others didn't contact me
in greater numbers.

<p>
I'll leave it to you to judge how wise it was to remove my domain name 
from the <i>hosts.deny</i> file ;-)

<a name="design"><strong>"
There are many technical strategies to
keep in mind while attempting to keep a site secure, and, combined
with the incredible fluidity and dynamism of computer security today,
it is increasingly difficult to use techniques and architectures
that are ill-designed for our current situation."</strong></a>
</blockquote>

<p>

Most of the protocols, programs, and computer in use today were
designed a long time ago (in computer or dog years, that is), and
while many perform admirably, quite a few suffer from the rapidly changing
social and technical environment that we live in.  They are very
much ingrained in our culture and our existing technology base, however, 
and it is very difficult to change them.

<blockquote>
<a name="farmers_law"><strong>"Farmer's law says that the security
on a computer system degrades the more you use the system."</strong></a>
</blockquote>
Rarely do security incidents happen simply because an intruder is being
brilliant.  Most potential problems are there due to carelessness or
lack of foresight, either in the architecture, design, and implementation 
side or in the maintenance of the system by the system administrator.
As time goes on the chances that someone will discover problems of
the former type go up (e.g. the more people use an operating
system, the more problems will be found.)  And people make mistakes -
the more system administrators or users there are on a system, the greater
the likelihood is that a mistake will be made, and that intruders can
find their way past the defenses of the system.
<p>
Someone else probably has said this better, but I've been saying this
for years and I haven't read it anywhere else, so I'm claiming it 
for now ;-)

<a name="orgs_o_note"><strong>"Unfortunately, unlike the financial market, 
	there are no organizations of note that rate or give any assurance 
	that sites are secure."</strong>
</blockquote>

Some might point to the <a href="http://www.ncsa.com">NCSA</a> as an
organization that does just this.  If someone said this to me I would
repeat my previous quote.  While I have yet to meet an organization 
that is entirely without merit, I have so many issues with the NCSA and
their firewall and web server certification it is difficult to
know where to begin to criticize them.  Here are some of the more
damaging problems:

<ul>
<li> Their criteria for what makes a host "secure" are ambiguous and
	technically unsound.
<li> Their specifications are incomplete and filled with undefined
	buzz words.
<li> They have a page that is supposed to have a list
	of certified sites, so that you can verify that a site was truly secured
	by them.  It was last updated as of August 1, 1996,
	and says that "There are a number of sites currently being tested 
	for certification.  As soon as sites are certified, the name of 
	the site and the URL will be listed on this page."  I can only
	surmise that they could not get anyone to pay their fees,
	that no one has passed their test, or that they aren't updating
	the page.  Any of those makes their process worthless.
</ul>

In general, standards made by the same organization that wishes to 
make a buck off of validition of the same are odious.  I cannot think 
of any that were <strong>ever</strong> worth the paper (in this case, 
e-paper) they were printed on.

<p>

They do have a great, very true slogan, however:

<blockquote>
<strong>"Security is not a one-time event. It is a continual process."</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>
How true, how true.
