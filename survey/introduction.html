<h4>
(A Semi-Statistical) Security Survey of Key Internet Hosts & Various 
Semi-Relevant Reflections
</h4>

Recently there have been some security incidents on the Internet (most 
notably some break-ins and alterations of the contents of some high-profile 
Web sites, such as the 
<a href="http://www.2600.com/cia/">CIA</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.2600.com/doj_2600rush/">US Department of Justice</a>)
that caused a bit of commotion in the 
popular press.  Perhaps simply another day on the Internet,
where machines are routinely broken into, but, coupled with a 
<a href="http://www.bankamerica.com/p-finance/homebanking/homebanking.html">
recent advertisement</a> I received that offered on-line balances and seemed 
to indicate that I could schedule payments via the Internet, it caused me to
think more about the current situation on the Internet with 
respect to the hosts that are socially vital or otherwise 
high-profile (e.g. banks, federal sites, newspapers, commercial 
sites that make all of their money on the Web, etc.), especially with 
the current popular emphasis on Internet commerce and the mad rush of 
individuals and organizations willing to put massive amounts of information 
on the Web.  Are the virtual versions of these organizations as trustworthy 
and as safe as their real-life counterparts?

<p>

I decided to investigate what were to me the most interesting of the 
online sites - banks and 
<a href="glossary.html#credit_union">credit unions</a>, some US federal
computers, newspapers, and some pure online Internet commerce systems.
It is important to note that there is a significant difference between a 
bank or credit union WWW site and a real bank - currently a Web site 
is primarily an advertisement on the Internet.  Although some banks 
allow you to do simple balance queries via the Internet, even if you 
could break into one of the bank Web sites you couldn't actually steal 
any money!

<p>
After doing a non-intrusive survey of approximately 
<a href="footies.html#survey_hosts">1700 of these interesting Web sites</a>
on the Internet (and another 500 as a control
study) I discovered that the hosts that I studied are not only more 
vulnerable than
their real-life counterparts, but shockingly so.  Using relatively crude,
non-intrusive (i.e., no sites were actually broken into, no port-
scanning was done, etc.), and, as far as I am aware, 
<a href="footies.html#legal">perfectly legal</a>
techniques to analyze their security, I found 
that:

<p>

<ul>

<li> over <strong>sixty percent</strong> could be broken into
or destroyed (i.e. all network functionality deleted or removed).
The number is approximate by necessity (since I didn't verify my
suspicions by actually compromising the hosts) and is an upper bound
for the tests actually run, but should be a very good estimate.

<p>
<li> an additional 9-24% of these same hosts could be broken 
into if 
<a href="footies.html#single_bug">a single new bug were found</a>
(or known about by potential intruders) in either of two important and 
widely-used programs, <cite>wu-ftp</cite> and <cite>sendmail</cite>.
(Interestingly enough, within a month of completing this survey both of
these programs had such bugs reported.)

<p>
<li> when compared to the approximately 500 hosts that I selected at
random (sic) as a baseline group, the surveyed hosts were 
<strong>twice</strong> as potentially vulnerable!

This means that, even though these critical sites use numerous firewalls
and other protective measures routinely to protect themselves (most of
the hosts surveyed would typically be deemed critical or very
important), these measures were ineffective as a whole (although
individual sites are very effective at defending themselves with these
same defensive measures).  In addition, due to the extra services
typically run by these machines (such as WWW and NNTP), they exposed
themselves even more.

<p>
<li> no attempt was made to hide the survey, but only three
sites out more than two thousand contacted me to inquire what was going on 
when I performed the 
unauthorized survey (that's a bit over one in one thousand questioning 
my activity).  Two were from the normal survey list, and one was from 
my random group.

</ul>

<p>
I want to reiterate - the methods used by this survey were 
<strong>NOT</strong> rocket science!  I barely electronically
breathed on these hosts.  I used a widely-known and
freely available security scanning tool (SATAN) at a very modest 
scan level and some relatively simple additional tests that 
were all based on widespread knowledge (such as 
<a href="ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/">CERT advisories</a> and the 
<a href="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/WWW/faqs/www-security-faq.html">
	WWW security FAQ</a>).  All of the tests used will be released
in the next version of SATAN.

<p>

I would estimate that an additional 10-20% of the hosts 
that I examined could be compromised (broken into or rendered unusable
by other than denial of service attacks) relatively easily by using more
advanced and intrusive break-in techniques (such as NIS attacks,
IP spoofing, packet snarfing, attacking hosts that the targets trust, 
name service attacks, or by utilizing tests 
that I could not run on these survey hosts without their explicit and 
express permission.)  If I am correct, this would mean that somewhere around 
70 and 80 percent of the surveyed hosts have serious
flaws in their security; this does not count resorting to more effective 
methods (like 
<a href="glossary.html#se">social engineering</a>
and insider attacks), nor does it count various
simple and more effective denial of service methods (such as routing attacks,
SYN attacks (<a href="http://www.panix.com/statement.html">Panix</a>, a
network provider, was attacked heavily by these), and the recent
<a href="http://www.sophist.demon.co.uk/ping/">"ping of death"</a> problem)
that would bring many of these machines down in seconds.

I would say that to claim that we have a serious problem is an understatement.
It seems obvious from these findings that security and system administration
are very difficult to perform effectively and that the latent problems of 
securing a host or site are ill-understood.

<p>
I think that the greatest injustice is being done to the 
<strong>USERS</strong> of such sites and services.  They simply are not 
informed of the incredible number of potential security problems on 
these systems.  And much of the security information that gets
widespread popular coverage is 
<a href="footies.html#waterlogged">so watered down or simply incorrect</a>
as to be almost useless.
But who would use an on-line bank or trust their credit card
on the Web if they knew in advance that their site could be so
easily compromised by casual intruders, and even more easily by 
determined ones?

<p>

The rest of this paper will discuss the technical 
methods used to perform the survey, how the survey participants
were selected, current web methods of gathering info and how they work
and apply to security, and my more detailed and technical conclusions
and recommendations.
