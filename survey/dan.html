I spend much of my time thinking about security and listening to music.
Yeah, a real party animal.  I live with my two great cats in berkeley
(CA), have a motorcycle but no car, a T-1 and a fair bit of pretty cool 
(& mostly red) wine and port.  Check out either <cite>pre-millenium 
tension</cite> or <cite>the kinks are the village green preservation 
society</cite> if you want some really good music.

<p>

I used to have a home page that went into some detail about me and my
thoughts, but I'm a bit too worn out for that right now (for a
variety of reasons.)

On the work side, in case you're wondering, I'm a security researcher and 
consultant; I primarily like to <cite>think</cite> about things.  I
write software and papers, audit and analyze systems and sites, and give 
recommendations and reports on the status and potential vulnerabilities 
of organizations.  I almost always refuse offers to give talks or 
classes, but might do it if it's interesting enough.  

However, wietse venema and I are giving free full-day classes from time to 
time; we're hoping to do our next one this year, in Java (the country).  
If you'd like to sponsor us, please 
<a href="mailto:satan@fish.com">let us know!</a>  If you simply want to 
attend, please don't ;-)  We'll announce it when it's ready.

<p>

Some stuff I've done:

<li> <a href="http://wzv.win.tue.nl/satan/">SATAN</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.fish.com/security/admin-guide-to-cracking.html">
	Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking Into It</a> - 1993 
	Internet white paper
<li> <a href="http://wzv.win.tue.nl/book/courses/auditing_course/handouts.html">
	Internet Auditing class</a> - an eight hour class on Internet auditing
<li> <a href="http://www.trouble.org/survey/">Internet security survey</a>
</ul>

I'm a purdue guy, graduating from there with a bachelor's degree, and 
have worked for Sun Microsystems (who I just quit working for), CERT, and 
SGI over the years in addition to my consulting work.

<p>

T'care and enjoy...

writing poetry at 71 mph helps sometimes<br>
on my way to work or going home<br>
theres a calmness and clarity<br>
why pavement looks so grey<br>
and i wonder about those black skidmarks<br>
did a husband go through the glass<br>
or are they bird's shadows as they passed by<br>
shadows -- i like the term<br>
is a good word for how i feel<br>
you know theres a kings ransom<br>
of scrap metal going down this road<br>
<IMG SRC="dot_clear.gif" width=10>in jaguars alone<br>

i try to go zen for a moment<br>
but a honda cuts me off and i lose my cool<br>
funny how problems fade<br>
when youre angry<br>
time melts away<br>
on the freeway<br>
funny how the roads so gray<br>
and i still cant write<br>
what im trying to say<br>
