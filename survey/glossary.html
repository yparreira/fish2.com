<a name="audit_trail"><strong>Audit trail.</strong></a>
An audit trail is literally a trail of data that can be used to 
reconstruct what happened at a later date.

<p>
<a name="cdv"><strong>Columbus Day Virus.</strong></a>
This refers to a virus that received incredible amounts of publicity
via worldwide mass media; it was scheduled to go off on Columbus Day but 
turned out to be a false alarm.

<p>
<a name="credit_union"><strong>Credit union.</strong></a>
"A cooperative group that makes loans to its members at
low rates of interest." (Websters unabridged.)  A credit union is 
synonymous with a bank to many; you can get ATM and credit cards, have 
savings and checking accounts, etc. with most of them.

<p>

<a name="crypto"><strong>Authentication and encryption.</strong></a>
<cite>Authentication</cite> is a method that verifies the identity of 
someone or something (a program, a computer system, whatever.)

<cite>Encryption</cite> is a way of transforming something (often
called "plaintext", which is typically electronically stored information 
such as text or programs) into "cyphertext" (something that is
unusable and unreadable in its current form.)  Depending on the 
encryption method used and whether keys are available or not you can 
sometimes you can <cite>decrypt</cite> the cyphertext back into the 
original plaintext.  (Passwords are often encrypted with a form of
encryption that cannot be decrypted, for instance.)

<p>
<a name="finger"><strong>Fingering.</strong></a>  "finger" is a
command that can be used to determine information about users either
locally or on remote machines.  The security problems associated with
allowing this service to be run were detailed in Wietse's and my paper
<a href="http://www.trouble.org/satan/satan-demo/demo/docs/admin_guide_to_cracking.html#finger"><cite>Improving the Security of Your System by Breaking into It</cite></a>.

<p>
<a name="rfc"><strong>RFC.</strong></a>  Request For Comments.  
The Internet has no
governing body or way to enforce standards.  The Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) is a group of concerned Internet citizens who meet
several times a year to discuss protocols and suggested behaviors.  The
documents that they produce are called RFC's, and these are essentially
the road maps that the Information Super highway follows (rather than the
other way around.)

<p>
<a name="policy"><strong>Security policy.</strong></a>
A security policy is a written document that details what an organization
requires with respect to security from its network, computers, property,
and employees.

<p>
<a name="shrift"><strong>Shrift.</strong></a>
1. The imposition of penance by a priest on a penitent after confession.<br>
2. Absolution or remission of sins granted after confession and
penance.<br>
3. Confession to a priest.<br>

<p>

(Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language.)

<p>
I just had to look this word up.  Cool.

<p>
<a name="se"><strong>Social engineering.</strong></a>
"Social Engineering uses very low cost 
and low technology means to overcome impediments posed by information 
security measures" (quote from reference below.) In other words, social
engineering is the skill of bullshitting or tricking someone in order
to get something that you want from them - for instance, a password or 
system access.
A reference to a really wonderful paper (<cite>Information Security 
Technology?...Don't Rely on It A Case Study in Social Engineering</cite>, 
by Winkler and Dealy) can be found in the <a href="papers.html">papers</a> 
page.

<p>
<a name="spam"><strong>SPAM.</strong></a>
Sending unsolicited junk e-mail or netnews articles to vast numbers of 
people or locations.

<p>
<a name="tiger"><strong>Tiger teams.</strong></a>
A tiger team is a group of people who attempt to get past the defenses
of a system or an organization that they work for (often indirectly; for
instance, the Navy might use its special force team to test the defenses
of a Naval base), in order to test its 
defenses.  Using a tiger team is usually a waste of time (compared to
a real audit or well-done survey) and not very effective technically,
but can often be very flashy and produce political results that are 
difficult to attain via more conventional methods.
