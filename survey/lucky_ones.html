<h3>Preparing for the survey</h3>

<p>
<IMG SRC="thin_rainbow_line.gif">
<p>

As far as I know, no one has done a survey like this on a public
network.  Governments, large corporations and accounting firms, 
and other organizations do routinely hire 
<a href="glossary.html#tiger">tiger teams</a>
to perform surprise attacks on their defenses either internally or 
when they audit their clients, but this survey used
a significantly different approach.

<p>

The GAO put out the very fine
<a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/useftp.cgi?IPaddress=wais.access.gpo.gov&filename=ai96084.txt&directory=/diskb/wais/data/gao"><cite>Computer Attacks at Department of Defense Pose Increasing Risks</cite></a>,

done by Congressional request where a US government assigned 
tiger team broke into vast numbers of military sites to test the security 
awareness and adherence to the security policy of the military systems.

<p>
My survey was only in the vaguest sense like a tiger team
approach (which I'm not very enamoured of, in any case; I feel that 
there are far better ways to examine security.)
Since I never even attempted to break into any systems, and the
methods I used looked primarily at potential security problems
from network services that were frequently used and the vulnerabilities
very well known, I expected very little interesting data from the 
survey.  The results were thus all the more surprising.

<p>
<h3>Forging ahead...</h3>
<p>

Traditionally it has been deemed to be "bad form" to perform certain
activities on the net.  <a href="glossary.html#spam">Spamming</a>, sending
or reforwarding chain e-letters, disclosing explicit details of 
security problems, and posting private e-mail are all examples of
this.  And while some of these are more acceptable today, performing an 
unauthorized technical survey that solicits details about remote hosts 
or sites, while not illegal, has never been explicitly socially condoned.  
But, even though performing a security survey on certain high profile sites is
not illegal, to many this is perhaps analogous to 
<a href="footies.html#jls">Jonathan Livingston Seagull</a>
buzz-bombing the elder gulls at speeds exceeding 100 MPH.

<p>
So why did I do it?  Or, rather, since I am
a rather well-known security researcher who probably could have gotten
a reasonably positive response if I had sent out a request for
survey participants, why didn't I attempt to get prior permission?

<p>
To start with, I was very interested in a rather small section of the 
Internet.  I felt that if even if I had asked all of the
potential participants for their explicit 
permission, the number of responses I received would have been 
very small, and perhaps statistically insignificant.
I also thought that merely asking might scare
them, and that the majority of the responses that I received would be 
those who put lots of time into their security 
setup, were very confident and knowledgeable about security, or
would run back to their system and quickly fix any security problems
before I could examine their system.  I decided that I needed 
a more random sample.

<p>
<h3>Searching for Godot</h3>
<p>
The Internet - the WWW in particular - for better or worse,
is getting more and more intrusive in its approach to this sort of
subject, and this helped fuel my decision.

For instance, the Network Information Center (NIC) not only controls the
domain namespace of the Internet, but also has a database that
contains architecture and operating system information; while the
information is taken from written applications rather than any sort
of technical or automated survey, it can be quite illuminating.
The oft-quoted survey results from
<a href="http://www.nw.com/zone/WWW/top.html">Network Wizards</a> is
one such example - over 100,000 hosts from all corners the world 
are remotely surveyed.  Dan Bernstein, a long-time net denizen, did a 
<a href="danb.html">vast SMTP scan</a> covering over 130,000 hosts, listing
what people were using as SMTP agent.  And, finally, a British company
called Netcraft did a web server survey of over <strong>600,000</strong>
web sites and placed the results in 
<a href="http://www.netcraft.co.uk/Survey/">a database</a>
that can be queried.  Want to know which educational sites are running
the Apache web server?  It will quickly dump out over 2000 of them, and
you can even query for the version number - it does all the work for you
(the Wall Street Journals' server, for instance, is the
Netscape-Commerce/1.1 with a certificate serial number of 0x027a000b.)
<a href="footies.html#netcraft">The security ramifications of this are 
fairly staggering.</a>  And all of these are done without anyone's
explicit permission; they are seen as doing the rest of the Internet
a service rather than causing problems.

<p>

WWW search engines are even more amazing in the amount of information
they routinely suck in and index.  As John M. Fisher of CIAC (the
Department of Energy emergency security response team) said, they
are so efficient at gathering information of all sorts that:

<blockquote>
... perhaps these search engines have become a little too
powerful. Some Web sites have provided a few too many links, including
information related to system configuration. For example, doing a
search for keywords such as "root", "daemon:", "passwd", etc, will
return back a few stray /etc/passwd or /etc/group files, located on
systems that have very poor Web configurations. This is a way to
quickly find those Web sites that are not maintained very well and are
most vulnerable to attack.

<h3>Bottom line</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately, time and resources were a significant issue as well.
I was doing this 
on my own time - I had no assistants, no paycheck, no nothing while
performing the survey.  The logistics of setting up a more formal survey,
such as gathering the potential participants, establishing secure 
communication channels, setting up times and dates for the experiments, 
etc., etc. were simply out of the question.  I had a very large amount of
curiosity but a very limited amount of time, and, since I viewed 
the project as a 
cultural and philosophical effort and not a legal one, I 
decided to risk censure, loss of trust, and the general ire of the net
by simply doing it.

<p>

I chose five categories of systems, primarily using 
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> to find my 
survey participants.  Yahoo is
really wonderful if you'd like to select from a known set of potential 
survey participants - or targets, if you're a system cracker.  With 
categories such as "News and Media: Newspapers: Indices" it does all the 
work for you.  According to their 
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/docs/info/faq.html">FAQ</a>,
Yahoo makes its lists based both on user submissions and by identifying as
many sites as they can find and verify, which was a reasonable
approximation of what I wanted in the survey.  I would be surprised
if I got much less than 10% of the total numbers of hosts of that type
on the entire Internet in the most of the categories; these organizations
<strong>want</strong> people to find them, or they wouldn't be on the 
WWW, and Yahoo is one of the most popular ways that people search for
Web services.  The odd numbers of 
hosts in the survey are simply because that's how many hosts Yahoo had 
in that category that answered to a ping:

<ul>
<li> <strong>US federal government interest computers.</strong>  Taken
	from some random person's page on the web (which helped start
	me on this whole survey thing), it covered Congress, miscellaneous
	government links, the executive and judicial branches, as well
	as miscellaneous intelligence communities.  I added the small
	Yahoo category of Federal Reserve WWW sites, but it was still
	the smallest group, with less than 50 sites.

<p>
<li> <strong>Bank WWW sites.</strong>  The single largest category, consisting
	of 660 banks from around the world.  This was an easy choice;
	I wanted something with a lot of credibility and assumed security.

<p>
<li> <strong><a href="glossary.html#credit_union">Credit Union</a> WWW 
	sites.</strong>  274 credit unions were 
	scanned.  I selected these for the same reasons as banks and to
	get more data points.

<p>
<li> <strong>Newspaper WWW sites.</strong>  312 North American based, 
	electronically published newspaper sites.  I thought the potential
	fascinating - what if intruders were to break into many different
	newspaper Web sites and change or add a headline or complete
	story?  The potential for misinformation is tremendous; a simple
	story of, say, a 747 crashing over La Gaurdia airport could 
	be utterly believable 
	and potentially devastating.  And if, say, the AP or Reuters
	news feeds were compromised...
<p>
	Bloom county was way ahead of its time, as per usual, with this
	brilliant cartoon published in the early 80's:
<p>

<p>


<p>
<li> <strong>Sex club WWW sites.</strong>  I wanted to have some group that
	was a pure Internet or Electronic commerce set of hosts.  These
	sites seemed to be a pretty good sample; they make their living selling
	pictures, stories, mpeg movies, and live on-line women and men
	via the WWW to subscribers.  Any Internet security problem would be
	devastating to their business.  451 hosts were scanned.

<p>
<li> <strong>Random group.</strong>  I wanted a random group; something
	I could use to compare to other hosts in the survey. I couldn't
	figure out whether to take random WWW sites or purely random hosts (at
	least, as random as I could reasonably make them.)  I
	decided on the latter.  469 hosts.
</ul>
