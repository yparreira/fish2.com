<H1> Internet Security Auditing Class Handouts </H1>
</P>
</CENTER>

On April 30th, 1996, Dan Farmer (Sun Microsystems) and Wietse Venema
(Eindhoven University) presented a full-day free class on security
auditing before an audience of 200 in Santa Clara (CA). The event was
sponsored by <A HREF="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</A>.

<P>

It is possible that we will give other classes in the near future.
These are one-time events, no recordings made. We do not intend to make
a living out of this, but hope such presentations help us to finish the
material for a book.

<P>

Warning - in order to view this material you need an up-to-date
PostScript printer or previewer.  
<UL>
<LI>Some files were created with MS WORD. These
require a PostScript level 3 printer: old printers and most, if not
all, GHOSTVIEW versions have problems. 
<LI>The files created with XFIG are
actually a concatenation of many little files; some really cheap
printers print only every other slide.

<P>

This material amounts to about 200 pages, so you can save a tree by
printing double sided.

<STRONG><P><LI> Introduction</STRONG>

<P><A HREF="intro.ps"> slides (intro.ps) </A>

<P>Dan opens the day with an introduction to key concepts of auditing:
what is an audit, the importance of security policies, why and when an
audit should be done, and who can do it.

<STRONG><P><LI> Case study #1: A simple firewall audit, with data inspired by real life </STRONG>

<P><A HREF="fw-audit.ps"> slides (fw-audit.ps) </A>

<P>Wietse examines a firewall - from the inside (so you can see the
light coming in through the cracks), and with a magnifying glass. The
examples show some typical problems.

<STRONG><P><LI> How to do a security audit (without really trying)</STRONG>

<P><A HREF="how2.ps"> slides (how2.ps) </A>

<P>This presentation expands on the material discussed earlier in the
morning.  In a talk that covers two time slots, Dan explains the
subject with great fervor, and illustrates his points with many
examples from personal experience (but not all of these are on the
slides).

<P><A HREF="tiger.ps"> intermezzo (tiger.ps) </A>

<P>Halfway through the presentation, Dan makes a little break to
discuss the not-so-subtle difference between a tiger team job and a
security audit.

<STRONG><P><LI> Lunch break</STRONG>

<STRONG><P><LI> Case study #2: The FISH.COM audit</STRONG>

<P><A HREF="fish-audit.ps"> slides (fish-audit.ps) </A>

<P>For the purpose of this security class, Wietse did an audit of the
the <A HREF="http://www.fish.com/"> FISH.COM </A> home network owned by
Dan and Muffy.  Even though the network is relatively small, the audit
already shows many types of problems that networked systems can suffer
from.  See also the sections below on <A HREF="#reporting"> writing a
security audit report </A>, and the <A HREF="#report"> final report
</A> itself.

<STRONG><P><LI> Networks, networks (and more networks)</STRONG>

<P><A HREF="networks.ps">slides (networks.ps) </A>

<P>Wietse mounts the floor again. Auditing a host is one thing,
auditing a network of hosts quickly becomes complicated because of
interactions between systems. The larger a network the less complete
the information. 

<P><A HREF="network-examples.ps"> slides (network-examples.ps)</A>

<P>Two examples of large-scale auditing of networks with 14000 to 25000
hosts, the results, and the reactions from the users. See also the <A
HREF="#appendix"> Appendix </A>.

<A NAME="reporting">

<STRONG><P><LI> Reporting (the hard stuff)</STRONG>

<P><A HREF="reporting.ps"> slides (reporting.ps) </A>

<P>Dan discusses what goes into a security audit report. Do not
underestimate the difficulty of this part. Writing the report is at
least as difficult as doing the audit itself. This presentation uses
the FISH.COM security audit as an example.

<A NAME="report">

<STRONG><P><LI>The pretty FISH.COM report</STRONG>

<P><A HREF="fish.ps"> report (fish.ps) </A>

<P>An audit report should be systematic, thorough, precise, readable,
and many other things. This report summarizes the results from the
FISH.COM audit.

<STRONG><P><LI> Case study #3: The firewall at Bell laboratories</STRONG>

<P><A HREF="att.ps"> slides (att.ps) </A>

<P>Wietse presents the results of a two-day visit, together with Dan,
to <A HREF="http://www.lucent.com/"> Bell laboratories</A>, one week
before the security audit class was given.  The firewall was quite
different from the one described in the Cheswick and Bellovin <A
HREF="http://www.aw.com/cp/Ches.html"> book </A>, and construction was
still going on while we were there.  Bill and Steve gave us full
insights into how things work.  Interesting, there is always a part
that the book does not tell about...

<A NAME="appendix">

<STRONG><P><LI>Appendix - Flirting with SATAN</STRONG>

<P><A HREF="nancy_cook.ps"> slides (nancy_cook.ps) </A>

<P>A short report by Nancy Cook and Marie Corbin who used SATAN to
reduce the vulnerability of a network of approximately 14000 hosts.
