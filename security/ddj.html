Computer Analysis: an Introduction</a></strong> by Dan and Wietse
(September 2000).

<p>

An introduction to the subject of computer forensic analysis and
to some of the technical traps and pitfalls that one needs to be
aware of.

<p>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.ddj.com/articles/2000/0010/0010f/0010f.htm">What are MACtimes?</a></strong> by Dan (October 2000).

<p>

Reconstructing the past from file access patterns, using the time
stamps that are recorded by UNIX and Windows file systems. This
column introduces the <b>mactime</b> tool.

<p>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.ddj.com/articles/2000/0011/0011g/0011g.htm">Strangers in the night</a></strong> by Wietse (November 2000).

<p>

An intruder leaves behind a running program of unknown origin.
The executable file is deleted. How does one figure out the purpose
of a running program without triggering a possible logical bomb?
<p>

<li><strong><a
href="http://www.ddj.com/articles/2000/0012/0012h/0012h.htm">Wanted,
dead or alive</a></strong> by Wietse (December 2000).

<p>

An intruder compromises a friend's machine and deletes most of the
files. To investigate the case, Dan and Wietse write the first
version of their file recovery tools and stumble from discovery
into discovery. By looking at file access time patterns of deleted
file inodes, Wietse finds that deleted file information can stay
around much longer than expected.

<p>

<li><strong><a
href="http://www.ddj.com/articles/2001/0101/0101h/0101h.htm">Bring
out your dead</a></strong> by Dan (January 2001)

<p>

This is part two on Dan and Wietse's experiences with recovering
files from a thrashed machine. Dan presents the <b>lazarus</b>
program, an amazing tool to sift through deleted information.

<p>

<li><strong><a
href="http://www.ddj.com/articles/2001/0104/0104f/0104f.htm">Being 
prepared for intrusion</a></strong> by Dan and Wietse
(April 2001)

<p>

This column is not about intrusion detection - it is about being
prepared for the intrusion that will inevitably happen. The column
discusses how to instrument hosts and networks, so that you can
find out what happened, and so that you can avoid being taken by
complete surprise.
