I did a variety of things while working for my company Elemental Security.
Here's are a couple of rather obscure papers that I, at least, had fun
with.  They should be read in order - first the value one, then risk.
But the basic premise is that I believe you can get relative values of
computers and users by watching their behavior along with some basic
attributes.  And if you could actually programmatically calculate the
value of a host then perhaps you could get a indication of risk as well.

<p>

In any case here they are, as presented to the engineering team,
which then eviscerated them and brought a bit more rigor to the topic.
They never were meant for publication, but that's the web is all about ;)
Note that I tried to remove any Elemental refs, but c'est la vie, YMMV,
etc., etc.
