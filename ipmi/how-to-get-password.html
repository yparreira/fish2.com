	The usual mindset is that only a small group of trusted individuals can
	ever have the IPMI password for a group.  However, there are numerous
	ways to get an IPMI password; some are targeted attacks, some are
	opportunistic, but all are effective.  With shared password it only
	takes one compromised server to ruin everyone's day.
   </p>
	
	<ul>
	
	<li><p class="grid">
	Try the vendor default password!  You never know.  You can also try
	a brute force approach - I've found that some vendors don't do
	timeouts or exponential back offs on their web servers, and you can
	brute force password guessing fairly quickly.  And since it's not
	generally monitored (and the logs usually stored locally and not sent to
	a logging server) you can do this for a very long time without notice.
	Of course if you can get a server via eBay or whatnot you can try brute
	force for a very, very long time before the password is changed.
   </p></li>
	
	<li><p class="grid">
	Sniffing the network, either on a host or on the network itself
	if practical.  In the real world quite a bit of IPMI traffic is sent
	unencrypted, including passwords.  Version 2.0 of the IPMI specification
	details RCMP+, which was meant to be an upgrade to the old, unencrypted
	RCMP, but many still default (and all still allow) to the bad old days of
	clear text.  Since the passwords are sent en masse to a lot of systems on
	a regular basis - say, every few minutes or so for physical monitoring
	- you'll have lots of chances.  At times IPMI implementations try to
	prevent servers from sniffing on the interface that IPMI runs.
   </p></li>
	
	<li><p class="grid">
	Monitoring or management servers and/or consoles.  Automation is
	the key in the real world, and scripts have passwords embedded in them.
	Management applications also will contain the passwords in configuration
	files or in a usually-easy-to-read database.
   </p></li>
	
	<li><p class="grid">
   Mobile devices.  The rush to put as much as possible on IOS, Android
   and the like hasn't stopped with IPMI; HP has their own iPhone
   app and a variety of 3rd party developers support the various IPMI
   features.  The IPMI passwords are stored inside the phone's
   storage, so steal or find a phone today.

	<li><p class="grid">
	Laptops or personal computers of administrators. One of the primary
	ways of interfacing with IPMI is over a web browser.  People being people,
	you know the browser has those passwords in the cache on the various
	systems they use.  You can also put a keystroke logger, sniff traffic,
	or various other methods .
   </p></li>
	
	<li><p class="grid">
	Compromise a BMC.  Either from the server it runs on or directly to
	its network interface if someone is foolish enough to leave it exposed.
	If you managed to get a BMC, the password is pretty simple to get.
	Here are some simple ways:
   </p></li>
	
   <ul>

	   <li><p class="grid">
	   a. Look in physical memory ("/dev/mem" or whatever.)  It can be
	   useful to add a new IPMI account with an odd password to help here;
	   if your newly added password of "rumpelstiltskin"
	   in memory it's a good bet the other account names and passwords
	   are nearby.
      </p></li>
	
	   <li><p class="grid">
	   Look in process memory.  IPMI seems routinely implemented as a normal
	   Linux daemon/agent, and I've had no issues getting the memory via
	   /dev/mem and /proc to recover the password.
      </p></li>
	
	   <li><p class="grid">
	   Look in the file system.  On my Supermicro server they're kept in
	   "/conf/PMConfig.dat"; your own mileage may vary.
      </p></li>
	
	   <li><p class="grid">
	   Some keep the passwords in semi-encrypted fashion; while Dell doesn't
	   keep the passwords in clear text in the file system, they do a simple
	   SHA1 hashing of them stored at "/flash/data0/etc/avctpasswd"; a decent
	   password cracker will make short work of this, as they haven't salted.
      </p></li>
   </ul>
	
	<li><p class="grid">
	Backups.  Data tends to migrate here (except when you need it!) -
	compromising a backup server can be pretty devastating.
   </p></li>
	
	<li><p class="grid">
	Physical access.  There are lots of ways to do this - buying
	a server on eBay, being part of the cleanup crew or a junior
	system administrator, etc., etc.  If you have physical access you
	can either simply plug in the computer and talk to the network
	interface or extract the data from the ROMs.
   </p></li>

	Some might call this cheating, since physical access is generally
	not really a concern to the vast majority of security controls,
	but this is different than compromising a single smart card or
	something - with IPMI physical access to one system, no matter
	how insignificant or forgotten or old it is - can grant access
	to lots of other systems.  It's not cheating, it's design.
   </p></li>

	</ul>
