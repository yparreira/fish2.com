   <p style="margin-top: 20px;" class="grid">

   I'm not a pen tester, but there are some concepts that might be a
   bit unusual WRT the relationships between the IPMI trinity of the
   server, the BMC, and the IPMI protocol.  I'll use "root" as a slang
   for an administrative account on any of the three, and when I say
   IPMI I'm referring to the vendor-supplied server management interface
   (iDRAC, iLO, etc.) that probably has a lot of other features not in
   the IPMI spec.  I think that hardware hackers will find a field day
   with this one.

   </p> <p>

   If you can get root on the server you have root on IPMI, because you
   toot accounts on a server can create local administrative IPMI accounts
   without any additional authentication (you can't typically extract
   passwords, however.)  If you have root on IPMI you can control the
   server - the most straightforward way is illustrate this is to simply
   reboot the system onto media of your choice and mount the local drives;
   you may then install a new account, a new OS, or do whatever you wish - 
   after all, provisioning servers is one of the basic uses of IPMI.
   And if you have root on the BMC you have control of IPMI and also by
   proxy the server (I'll ignore more devious ways of control for now.)

   </p> <p>

   The part that isn't so certain is how to compromise the BMC.  Of course
   my Supermicro (SM) simply gave me a root prompt after I enabled IPMI
   and logged in via SSH - you may as well see if the front door is open
   or not. (And if you have physical access to the server you can try
   any number of physical attacks or data extraction; out of the scope
   of this little doc.)  In general shell access can be leveraged to get
   root on a system, but the security of BMC's that 've seen have been
   so poor it suggests that pretty much everything runs as root anyway,
   so any time you can execute a command you'll control the BMC.

   Most server vendors make flash images for BMCs freely available
   on their web sites.  It can be highly instructional and useful to
   download an image for the BMC in question (ideally the same version)
   and unpack the image (there is a lot on the net about this, and some
   good tools.  I reference some in my bibliography but the wifi hacker
   crowd has some fine examples and writeups on this.)  This is
   what I personally did to compromise the BMC on my Dell.

   <p>

   The flash contains the bootloader and operating system that the BMC
   uses to boot (configuration data, passwords, and additional data and
   programs are hidden inside as well.)  If you can unpack it you have
   an excellent roadmap for an attack strategy.

   </p> <p>

   An interesting facet of flash images is that BMC's running the same
   image are all the same, so if you can compromise one in the lab you
   should be able to compromise one in the wild. This is because you
   can't really configure or remove services on the BMC as you would do
   in a real operating system - even if services are disabled they're
   simply dormant, waiting to be re-enabled.  So any vulnerable service
   opens up opportunities on large numbers of other servers.  There is
   generally no patching of a vulnerability - instead an entirely new
   flash image is installed, from the boot loader on down.

   You'll want to ensure you can talk to the BMC and/or IPMI.  If you can,
   ignore this, but if you cannot....

   </p> <p>

   IPMI has three basic ways of communicating to the outside world -
   via the vendor's web interface, via UDP port 623 on the BMC's network
   interface, and when logged into the server it's attached to via kernel
   interfaces (this may have to be enabled.)

   </p>

   <li>

   If IPMI is using VLANs either disable it or make it use the same VLAN
   as the server.

   </li><li>

   If you're on a different network than IPMI or the BMC (e.g. its network
   jack is on a different network you can't directly access) then use IPMI
   (via web or command line) to change the IP number and network interface
   that the BMC is listening to; match either the same interface as the
   server or another interface that shares a network you can talk to
   (many servers have 3 or more jacks; 2 redundant on the main server
   net and one for the management net.)  This should in theory allow
   you to communicate, but it might take a reboot or network trickery
   to get a server to communicate to its BMC - you may have to use a
   3rd machine to communicate to the server's BMC because the vendor
   refuses to allow the server to directly communicate to its BMC.

   </li><li>

   Turn on all the network services that the BMC offers.  Keep in mind
   that all of those things are running on the BMC - if you can find a 
   vulnerability in the web interface or any of the other network services
   you can potentially get shell access to the BMC.

   Of course, if you don't already know, find out the OS and if possible
   the IPMI versions and vendor on the firmware side.  Nmap, probing,
   prodding, looking at the web UI should tell you this much.

   </p> <p>

   Run any scanners you can to see if an automated attack can be found either
   against the web interface or against the running network services.
