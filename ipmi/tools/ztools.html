   I wrote some software to explore IPMI; here are some of results.  I thought I'd 
   do the usual detect, get data, and audit sort of cycle.  Each of these turned
   out to be fairly interesting problem on its own.

   </p> <p class="grid">

   <h4>Password Cracking</h4>

   Here's a <a href="http://fish2.com/ipmi/tools/rak-the-ripper.pl">little Perl program</a> 
   that tries to guess an account on a remote BMC, extract its hash,
   and then try to crack its (HMAC hashed) password.  I wrote up a
   <a href="http://fish2.com/ipmi/remote-pw-cracking.html">little</a>
   bit on this for the curious.  Heavily commented, it may provide some utility.

   <h4>Detection</h4>

   Well, if you can talk to UDP port 623, it's pretty simple
   to find out if a remote system is running IPMI.  Unless you're inside
   a data center, however, most folks block UDP.  And even if they
   don't... UDP scanning is about as slow as can be imagined.  So I'm
   currently using two basic methods, leveraging the venerable Nmap and
   ipmiping (from the FreeIPMI Gnu tools.)  The easiest thing to do is:

   </p> <p class="grid">

   <ul>
   <li>Use ipmiping to ask a remote system if it speaks IPMI or not.  A positive
       response is the strongest indication that a system speaks IPMI
       (but nothing is certain!) More technically it sends two IPMI
       Get Channel Authentication Capabilities calls via a Get Channel
       Authentication Capabilities request datagram on UDP port 623 (two
       requests since it's using UDP, and connections aren't guaranteed.)

       </p> <p class="grid">

       Since Nmap is far more efficient at scanning large scale networks
       than ipmiping this method is only used if Nmap says that a hosts
       has UDP 623 open.

       </p> <p class="grid">

       For better or worse this port is often blocked, so much of the
       time other methods are more likely to find out obliquely whether
       or not IPMI is running.

   <li>The second method is a bit squishy, and relies on a bit of
       induction (aka guessing.) Nmap scans ports that are known to be
       associated with IPMI and vendor additions; UDP 623 is obvious (the
       default IPMI port), but there are a variety of ports (both UDP and
       TCP) that by themselves might not immediately give you an answer,
       but when taken as a whole can strongly indicate its presence.
       TFTP, SNMP, SSH/SMASH, VNC, and many others are among these.

       </p> <p class="grid">

       Ports are weighted by their indicative ability and whether or not
       Nmap finds them open, filtered, or in other states.

       </p> <p class="grid">

       Nmap also can show the banners of services connected to.  I use
       regular expressions to hunt for targets - for instance the strings
       "iLO" and "DRAC" are good indicators that a system might be running
       HP's Integrated Lights Out service, or iLO.

       </p> <p class="grid">

       <strong>Note:</strong> Currently I do NOT use the broadcast
       ping method (a very quick way to zip through the subnet you're
       residing in); I simply don't have any data on the effectiveness
       on this; while very fast when it works I didn't feel like it
       allowed for the control and reliability of arbitrary scans.
       Two out of three of my systems (Dell and HP) responded to an
       RMCP ping.  None responded to a broadcast ping by idiscover
       (ipmiutil discover.)  All did, however, respond to my Python
       audit tool below.

       </p> <p class="grid">

       Unfortunately (of course!) the spectre of communications and
       networks comes into play -  nmap gives a bunch of different reasons
       as to why a port is open or not (open, closed, filtered, etc.)
       Yet another table has a set of weights that gives more points to
       an open port than to a "open|filtered" (as Nmap might say) hit.
       Interpreting nmap and weighting is a bit on the frustrating side,
       but c'est la vie.


       </p> <p class="grid">

       Take all the weights, add up all the points and you have an IPMI
       certainty level.  I've found in ad hoc testing that 15 points or
       more are strong indicators that the system is running IPMI.

       </p> <p class="grid">

       Currently I have various thresholds (no, possibly, probably,
       yes.) In tests - without having known access to any other servers
       than my own - it seems to work reasonably well.  That is,
       the things that I think are suspicious and my basic thought
       model above does indeed bubble certain servers to the top and
       leaves random hosts alone.  There are some real problems with
       false positives, tho - many firewalls seem to imply to nmap that
       there's something on any port (I've thought of tossing in a rare
       port or two (if you listen to something like port 1 & 31313,
       for instance, you're probably not *really* listening to it!)

       </p> <p class="grid">

       But this isn't meant to be the last word on the topic.  It should
       be fairly simple to get some decent data on IPMI banners, my
       guess is that it'd be by far the best way to rapidly scan large
       amounts of systems.

   </ul>
   </p> <p class="grid">

   Here are four pieces of Perl to implement the above; one scans,
   one interprets, and the other two are used for weighting.  It's a
   research tool or a proof of concept, not a production scanner, but
   it does produce some reasonable output.

   <strong>REQUIRED: Nmap version 6.</strong>

   Usage is pretty simple, if a bit quirky. Should be run as root. Verbose (-v) for lots of output.
   <blockquote>
   <pre>
   # standard run:
      ./ipmi_scan.pl -A -v -O yes  192.168.0.0/24
   # fast
      ./ipmi_scan.pl -tcp -v 192.168.0.0/24
   # kitchen sink
      ./ipmi_scan.pl -A -v -O high 192.168.0.0/24
   </pre>
   </blockquote>
   The scan will create a pair of result files that correspond to the
   target names (slashes are converted to underscores.) Simply run the
   post-processor on them; tossing through reverse numeric sort puts them
   in a more interesting order.  Anything over 10 I'd call suspicious,
   where > 20 is pretty certain to be running IPMI.  
   
   In this case I
   used the terse flag (-t) to cut the output to the bare minimum.

   <blockquote>
   <pre>
   ./post_ipmi_scan.pl -t 192.168.0.0_24|sort -rn

   </p> <p class="grid">
   In the above results the top 3 systems are actually running IPMI,
   but only the HP told Nmap that UDP port 623 was open - my Dell and
   Supermicro returned the more ambiguous "open|filtered" response,
   which is quite commonly a false alarm, bleah.  Perhaps it's better
   just to suck it up and do the IPMI ping in parallel with the scanner
   (or write an NSE to do it correctly in Nmap.)

   <h4>Audit</h4>

   Two programs here, one is a simple Python
   remote prober (starting to hate Perl, let me tell you) and a second
   that uses utilities from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/">FreeIPMI</a>
   to grab credentialed configuration data.

   </p> <p class="grid">

	A small python program (>50% inline comments, 2.5k gzip'd) that sends a single packet 
   to a BMC and mulls over the response.  What can you do with only a single packet, one 
   might ask?  10+ different security tests for IPMI, for starters.  Well, for starters 
   and for enders, it's only a packet :)  Requires python, a BMC and an open path to 
   UDP port 623 to work.  Usage is simply "ipmi-get-auth.py target".

   <p style="padding-left:60px;">
      <span style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #AAA;"> <a href="/ipmi/tools/ipmi-get-auth.py">ipmi-get-auth.py</a> /

   </p> <p class="grid">

   Here's a couple of small python programs that - using FreeIPMI tools - (a) sucks in the
   basic IPMI/BMC configuration of a server and (b) does a lil' security check on the results.

   </p>

   Because I... well, no good reason, actually.  One is in python3 and the
   other in python2. I guess I'm testing your readiness. The programs are
   pretty heavily commented, especially ipmifreely.py, so check that for
   more details on what's going on.  Requires simplejson and ConfigParser,
   maybe some more.

   </p> <p class="grid">

   <span style="color: #ff0000;">YOU MUST</span> have <a title="FreeIPMI"
   href="www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/" target="_blank">FreeIPMI</a>
   installed, which, as of this writing, kills off Mac and Windows chances
   at sucking down a cool JSON file from a server. And you really,
   really should have a recent version.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
   But life goes on.

   </p> <p class="grid">

   The data aquisition is done via a python program (I-check.py) that
   requires valid credentials to get data. It converts the results to
   JSON, which in turn may be checked by the audit tool (ipmifreely.py.)
   There is a sample policy in "IPMI-policy.ini", where I put some values
   for testing.
