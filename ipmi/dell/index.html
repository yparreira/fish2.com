<h4>Detecting Dell iDRACs remotely.</h4>

There are many ways to do this, of course... but this seems to work on
most of them.  Fetch a https URL from the system, like so (-k option in
curl tells it to ignore the bad cert that's almost certainly there):

<blockquote>
   curl -k https://10.0.0.1/cgi-bin/discover
</blockquote>

And it'll spit out some XML that looks something like:

<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;&lt;DISCOVER&gt;&lt;RESP&gt;&lt;RC&gt;0x0&lt;/RC&gt;&lt;ENDPOINTTYPE&gt;iDRAC&lt;/ENDPOINTTYPE&gt;&lt;ENDPOINTVER&gt;1.00&lt;/ENDPOINTVER&gt;&lt;PROTOCOLTYPE&gt;HTTPS&lt;/PROTOCOLTYPE&gt;&lt;PROTOCOLVER&gt;2.0&lt;/PROTOCOLVER&gt;&lt;/RESP&gt;&lt;/DISCOVER&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

So... of course I had to look around... it looks like it doesn't work on some,
but why, I have no idea. BMCs are flakey at best.  I got results for ENDPOINTTYPEs
DRAC5, iDRAC (that looks like iDRAC 6), iDRAC7, and just a handful of iDRAC6Ms, 
whatever those are.

<p>

Hunting around I didn't see any mention at all for those XML string values... except
in one place, a patent app filed by Quanta computer inc:

<p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2008/0120709.html">Management interface between embedded systems and computer system medium using the same </a>
</blockquote>

<p>

Oddly named, but it also has the same details and names pretty verbatim;
given the patent covers embedded servers I doubt it's a coincidence....

<blockquote>
<pre>

&lt;?xml version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;MODULE_DISCOVER&gt;
&lt;RESPONSE&gt;
&lt;RC&gt;0x0&lt;/RC&gt;
&lt;OUTPUTLEN&gt;0xXXXX&lt;/OUTPUTLEN&gt;
&lt;ENDPOINTTYPE&gt;Switch Blade&lt;/ENDPOINTTYPE&gt;
&lt;ENDPOINTVERSION&gt;1.0&lt;/ENDPOINTVERSION&gt;
&lt;PROTOCOLTYPE&gt;XML&lt;/PROTOCOLTYPE&gt;
&lt;PROTOCOLVER&gt;1.0&lt;/PROTOCOLVER&gt;
&lt;/RESPONSE&gt;
&lt;/MODULE_DISCOVER&gt;

Add another to the detection bag of trix.

<h4> guts below... </h4>

Very simple to get into the guts here.  I'm not saying much about the Dell yet
since I'm still talking to the Dell folks about how I got into it and they
wanted some more time.

<p>

(BTW, binaries for the rather odd armv5tejl may be found
<a href="http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/debianslug/cross/4.8-beta/">here</a>.
To unpack, do "ar xv filename.ipk"... then unpack again on the data file,
as such "tar xzvf data.tar.gz".)

<p>

Remote debugging?  Easy!  Get the gdbserver from the repository above... and:
<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
[WPCM450 /tmp/$ <strong>./gdbserver :6666 --attach 28598</strong>
Attached; pid = 28598
Listening on port 6666
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
And on the second machine, just connect when in GDB with "(gdb) remote 10.0.0.1:6666"
<p>

I believe that these are the basic files that make up the iDRAC stuff;
from a service list file in /etc:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
[WPCM450 /]$ <strong>cat /etc/sysconfig/idrac_service.list</strong>
# List of services for self-test results
# Do NOT leave any blank line in the file!!!
/avct/sbin/os
/avct/sbin/osinet
/avct/sbin/pm
/bin/ipmi_gateway
/bin/ipmi_monitor
/bin/ttymonitor
/sbin/aim
/sbin/avct_server
/sbin/klogd
#/sbin/openwsmand
/sbin/sfcbd
/sbin/sshd
/sbin/syslogd
/sbin/watchdog
/usr/local/bin/appweb
/usr/local/bin/guiDataServer
/usr/local/bin/serviceman
/usr/sbin/ipmiextd
/usr/sbin/raclogd
#udhcpc
#/bin/fullfw
# This is end of the list
</pre>
</blockquote>
