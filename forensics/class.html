On August 6th, 1999, Dan Farmer 
and Wietse
Venema (<a href="http://www.watson.ibm.com/">IBM T.J. Watson Research Center</a>)
presented a full-day free class on UNIX computer forensics analysis,
sponsored by IBM.

The class was attended by an audience of over 200 and was given at
the IBM T.J.  Watson Research Center near Yorktown Heights (NY).

<p>

At the end of the class, official 
<a href="/forensics/eln-badge.jpg">gold Internet Detective badges</a>
were handed out to attendees, courtesy of Earthlink Network.

<h4>TCT</h4>

The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT), described in the class, is
available for downloading <a href="/tct/">here</a>.

<h4>Class Transparencies</h4>

All slides used in presenting the class are below, in postscript and PDF
form (the latter require <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">AcroRead 4.0</a>
from adobe to read; thanks to Simson Garfinkle for creating them.)  The PS 
files were created with MS Power Point (e.g. those done by Dan) require 
a PostScript level 3 printer: old printers and old GHOSTVIEW versions 
have problems.  The files created with XFIG (e.g. those created by Wietse)
are actually a concatenation of many little files. They will not display 
properly if your viewer expects embedded pagination information. In order to view, 
try, for example:

<blockquote>
<p><tt>cat file.ps | ghostview -landscape -</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>

This material amounts to 215 pages, so you can save a tree by
printing double sided - or, better yet, print out the six-to-a-page
version created by Dave Dittrich which compacts them by a considerable
amount, and remains very easy to read.

<strong>Individual Files and Summaries</strong>
<p>

<UL>

<li> <strong>Introduction</strong>

<a href="/forensics/intro.ps">(intro.ps)</a>,
<a href="/forensics/intro.pdf">(intro.pdf)</a>

<p> Dan gives a look ahead to the rest of the day, what the class
will and won't cover, and discusses basic principles.

<p>

<li> <strong>Basic UNIX file system</strong>

<a href="/forensics/basic-files.ps">(basic-files.ps)</a>,
<a href="/forensics/basic-files.pdf">(basic-files.pdf)</a>

<p> Wietse presents a first case, and discusses limitations of
computer forensics analysis, the triangle of trust, and the reverse
Turing test.

<p>

<li> <strong>Freezing the scene</strong>

<a href="/forensics/freezing.ps">(freezing.ps)</a>,
<a href="/forensics/freezing.pdf">(freezing.pdf)</a>

<p> Dan explains what one needs to be aware of when capturing
information after an intrusion, what techniques to use, and what
mistakes to avoid. Central elements are the Heisenberg principle
of computer forensics and the order of volatility.

<p>

<li> <strong>Time travel</strong>

<a href="/forensics/time-travel.ps">(time-travel.ps)</a>,
<a href="/forensics/time-travel.pdf">(time-travel.pdf)</a>

<p> Wietse reconstructs the course of events from logfiles and from
other time-related information. This section is illustrated with
a short 
post-mortem intrusion analysis</a> 
that Wietse wrote up a couple years ago -
<a href="/forensics/intrusion-report.ps">PS version</a>,
<a href="/forensics/intrusion-report.pdf">PDF version</a>.

<p>

<li> <strong>Reconstruction of actions</strong>

<a href="/forensics/command-reconstruction.ps">(command-reconstruction.ps)</a>,
<a href="/forensics/command-reconstruction.pdf">(command-reconstruction.pdf)</a>

<p>Dan has the floor. This section is illustrated with two hand-outs:
what the intruder sees (
<a href="/forensics/handout-1.ps">PS version</a>,
<a href="/forensics/handout-1.pdf">PDF version</a>) and
what file system time stamps (
<a href="/forensics/handout-1b.ps">PS version</a>,
<a href="/forensics/handout-1b.pdf">PDF version</a>)
the intruder leaves behind.

<p>

<li> <strong>Processes</strong>

<a href="/forensics/processes.ps">(processes.ps)</a>,
<a href="/forensics/processes.pdf">(processes.pdf)</a>

<p>

<p> Wietse figures out the purpose of an unknown program that
runs on the system, without disturbing it, and without giving it
a chance to inflict damage to the system it runs on.

<p>

<li> <strong>Decompilation</strong>

<a href="/forensics/programs.ps">(programs.ps)</a>,
<a href="/forensics/programs.pdf">(programs.pdf)</a>

<p>

<p> In the middle of the graveyard shift, Wietse figures out the
purpose of a program file without actually running it. In this
session, Tsutomu Shimumura said: "adb is your friend". Dan replied:
"no, adb is <b>your</b> friend!"

<p>

<li> <strong>Networks</strong>

<a href="/forensics/networks.ps">(networks.ps)</a>,
<a href="/forensics/networks.pdf">(networks.pdf)</a>

<p> Dan discusses what information is left behind in the network
in the wake of an incident. It is impossible to erase all traces,
but then it can be hard to get that data from providers, telco's,
etc.

<p>

<li> <strong>Advanced UNIX file system</strong>

<a href="/forensics/advanced-files.ps">(advanced-files.ps)</a>,
<a href="/forensics/advanced-files.pdf">(advanced-files.pdf)</a>

<p> Wietse goes into the gory details of collecting information
about removed files, discusses how to hide information in and
in-between files and file systems, and how to erase traces from
UNIX file systems.

<p>

<li> <strong>Lazarus</strong> 

<a href="/forensics/lazarus.ps">(lazarus.ps)</a>,
<a href="/forensics/lazarus.pdf">(lazarus.pdf)</a>

<p> Dan presents of a novel tool that makes sense out of thrashed
files, how it works, why it works, and what its limitations are.

<p>

<li> <strong>Conclusion</strong>

<a href="/forensics/conclusion.ps">(conclusion.ps)</a>,
<a href="/forensics/conclusion.pdf">(conclusion.pdf)</a><br>

<p> Dan ends the day with a summary of best practices: what you
need at the very least in order to be prepared for an incident.
