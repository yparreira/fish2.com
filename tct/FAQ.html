<h3>Basic - A:</h3>

<a name="what"><strong>What the hell is it?</strong></a>

The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT) is a collection of tools designed to assist
in a forensic examination of a computer.  It is primarily designed for
Unix systems, but it can some small amount of data collection & analysis from
non-Unix disks/media.

<p>
<a name="where"><strong>Where do I get it?</strong></a>
TCT is available in two main locations:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.fish.com/tct">http://www.fish.com/tct</a><p>
and<p>
<a href="http://www.porcupine.org/forensics">http://www.porcupine.org/forensics</a><p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="systems"><strong>What systems does it run under?</strong></a><br>
Currently the following OS's are at least semi-supported (e.g. the more 
recent versions of the OS should work):
<p>
<blockquote>
  FreeBSD 2-4.*<br>
  OpenBSD 2.*<br>
   BSD/OS 2-3.*<br>
    SunOS 4-5.*<br>
    Linux 2.*<br>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>
<a name="license"><strong>Why isn't it GPL'd?  What license is it under?
Is it free?</strong></a>

The TCT is essentially free for most purposes.  While we applaud the
GPL and what it has done, we're not personally interested in using it.
Wietse, working for IBM, has to release his work under IBM's
<a href="LICENSE">Public License Version 1.0</a>.
dan has released pretty much all his stuff by a very 
<a href="COPYRIGHT">slightly modified BSD</a> version.  The work is
therefore somewhere between the two; files that are explicitly authored
(in the code or documents) to be authored by Wietse are covered by the
IBM's license, the rest are either by the modified BSD or some combination
of the two.  A bit of a mess, we're not anticipating any legal challenges.
Ask us if you have any doubts or questions.

<p>
<a name="dist"><strong>Can I put it on a CD in a book, Unix distro,
etc.?</strong></a><br>

You're welcome to redistribute it as long as (a) give us credit for
our work, (b) keep it intact, and (c) follow what our copyrights/license 
statements say.  We'd also appreciate being notified, but that's not
a requirement.

<p>
<a name="email"><strong>How can I get in touch with Wietse 
or dan?</strong></a>

E-mail to both authors can be sent to
<A HREF="mailto:tct@fish.com">tct@fish.com</A>.
We'll try to answer it, but please be aware
that we only work on TCT in our (very) part time.  You might also try
posting to <I>comp.security.unix</I> for answers.
Failing either of these, you can send mail directly to dan or Wietse:
<blockquote>
<ADDRESS><A HREF="mailto:zen@fish.com">zen@fish.com</A></ADDRESS><br>
<ADDRESS><A HREF="mailto:wietse@porcupine.org">wietse@porcupine.org</A></ADDRESS>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="class"><strong>I heard that they did a class on this stuff - 
when will they do it again?</strong></a>
While we did do a class on forensic computing (the 
<a href="/forensics/class.html">notes are online</a>), we will probably not do it 
again, as it was mostly a vehicle we utilized to teach ourselves more 
about the material you see before you.

<a name="broken"><strong>I've just been broken into.  Help!</strong></a>
First of all, we do not have the time or resources to personally help you 
with your investigative problems.  And since there's no way we can think 
of telling you in a way that will soften the blow, let us simply say it 
outright -  WRT the TCT, you're probably out of luck.  The tools probably 
won't help you out unless you've already looked at it, played with it, and 
know what the tools do as well as what to expect from them.  The 
investigation of breakins can be a very complex subject.

<p>

That said, they still might help and you may get lucky.  Don't give up!
Download them on a clean, undamaged system and read the documentation.
There's a 
<a href="help-when-broken-into">short tutorial</a>
we put together that might assist you.  Good luck!

<p>
<a name="delete"><strong>I've just deleted a file.  Help!</strong></a>
Unix is rather unforgiving when you blow away files.  However, the unrm
and lazarus tools (in TCT) could help, and there's yet another
<a href="help-recovering-file">short tutorial</a>
we put together that might assist you getting your data back.  Good luck!

<p>

Note - if you're running Linux there are a couple of other resources 
you might investigate -

<p>
<a name="list"><strong>Is there a mailing list that discusses 
the TCT?</strong></a>
Yes, there is a mailing list (with on-line archive) for sharing
experiences. To subscribe, send a message to majordomo@porcupine.org
with body (not subject): subscribe tct-users. The list will reject mail
from non-members so it is unlikely to catch UCE. To unsubscribe, send
mail with as body (not subject): unsubscribe tct-users.

<p>
<a name="biblio"><strong>I'm interested in learning more about
forensic computing, etc.  Can you suggest any good reading 
material?</strong></a>

Check out the <a href="bibliography">bibliography</a> we include in the
toolkit.

<p>

<a name="pipe"><strong>What's the deal with that little pipe?</strong></a>

The image is taken from René Magritte's 1929 painting "La trahison
des images", which is usually translated as "The Treachery of Images"
or "The Betrayal of Images".  The image is of a pipe with writing
underneath, which says "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" - or, "This is not
a pipe."  Magritte, when asked why the image he had painted was not a
pipe, reportedly responded "because I can't use it as a pipe".

<p>

At first blush this might seem to be a trivial or even foolish statement,
but this would be a serious mistake to make.

<p>

We use this as our primary metaphor for our work in forensic computing
analysis.  What we're examining is never the actual object - it is always
a representation, usually several layers and abstractions removed - of
the actual thing, which we can never truly ascertain.  The image could
be an artist's rendering of a real pipe. It could also be completely made
up by the artist.  It could be a seriously flawed copy of the real item.
You can't tell the difference simply by looking at the image.

<p>

Computers are subject to the treachery of images as well.  The image on
your computer screen is not a computer file - it's only an image on a
computer screen. Images of files, processes and network connections are
very distant cousins of the actual bits in memory, in network packets,
or on disks. The images that you see are produced by layer upon layer of
hardware and software.  When an intruder compromises a system any of those
layers could be tampered with.  Application software can lie, operating
system kernels can lie, boot PROMs can lie, even hard disk drives can lie.

<p>

We feel that all these complexities are superbly displayed by M. Magritte,
who illustrates in this and other works how the appreciation and
understanding of concepts and objects exist on many different levels.

<a name="bigfiles"><strong>I have a large file (greater than 2 GB) 
that lazarus says it can't open.  What can I do?</strong></a>
Lazurus uses perl to process the file.  In order to access large files
you need to use an operating system and perl binary that can handle such
a large file (such as *BSD systems, Solaris with a perl compiled under
64 bit support, and Linux systems with kernels and a version of perl
that is compiled for large file support.)
