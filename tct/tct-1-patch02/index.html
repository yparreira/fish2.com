This patch fixes a few bugs in the mactime and makes the ils and
ils2mac utilities more useful for exploring the inodes of deleted
files. See the CHANGES file below for details.

To appy the patch:

- step into the tct-1.01 top-level directory

- execute "make tidy"

- feed this file as standard input to the patch command.

- execute "make" to rebuild the programs.

*** 1,3 ****
--- 1,34 ----
+ 
+ Tue Aug  8 11:46:19 PDT 2000
+ 
+ o	created "help-recovering-file", added note to README.FIRST
+ 
+ Sat Aug  5 11:34:26 PDT 2000
+ 
+ o	mactime time range repaired, fixed docs, -l option slightly
+ 	fixed... perhaps deprecation in the future?
+ 
+ Fri Aug  4 20:06:15 EDT 2000
+ 
+ o	ils and ils2mac now include device names for more
+ 	readable mactime reports of dead inodes.
+ 
+ o	mactime could not run with current working directory
+ 	different from $TCT_HOME.
+ 
+ o	mactime -d could destroy an existing $DATA/body file.
+ 
+ o	mactime -d turned on verbosity, instead of letting -v do that.
+ 
+ o	mactime -s (suid) flag used an obsolete method of getting data.
+ 
+ o	ils2mac broke because perl split() can't see the difference
+ 	between empty last fields and missing last fields.
+ 
+ o	mactime mistakenly skipped files with all-zero time stamps.
+ 
+ o	ils2mac now emits ls -l like info for mactime compatibility.
+ 
  Tue Aug  1 13:50:20 PDT 2000
  
  o	Prepend our directory list to @INC rather than clobbering it.

+ So you've deleted an important file(s), or perhaps been broken into and
+ have your file system smashed by a vindictive system cracker, or some
+ other disaster has struck.  You need that file back, but Unix has no
+ way to recover lost data that hasn't been backed up.  You hunt around
+ for help, answers, anything, and perhaps run across this software or
+ had heard about it in the back of your mind.
+ 
+ To begin with, your data is *possibly* still out there somewhere -
+ TCT cannot help you if the data wasn't saved to disk first, however,
+ and it will take some time to hunt for data.
+ 
+ The following are problems for data recovery:
+ 
+ o	you do not have root privileges on the machine
+ 
+ o	you're inexperienced with Unix
+ 
+ o	you're in a hurry
+ 
+ o	the file is anything but small (say, greater than 15-20K).
+ 	It's still possible to recover larger files, but can be a
+ 	lot more difficult.
+ 
+ If you've lost email - especially a lot of it - you might look
+ at the "rip-mail" program in the "lazarus/post-processing" subdir.
+ 
+ We'd *HIGHLY* suggest you practicing on a few dummy files.  Go
+ ahead, remove some test files and follow the instructions below.
+ It's not that hard.
+ 
+ What you need in order to recover a deleted file:
+ 
+ o       A bit of knowledge about your system.
+ 
+ o	Spare disk space.  If not on your system, then on another system
+ 	that you can hook the original disk up to.  You'll need at least
+ 	*220%* of the free disk space of the file system that the file
+ 	was lost in.  The 220% is needed by:
+ 
+ 		100% = The unallocated blocks that you'll be recovering
+ 
+ 		120% = Roughly the space lazarus will consume.  It'll
+ 		       be at least 100% + some additional space.
+ 
+ o	At least a few hours of time (much of this will not be you doing 
+ 	any work, but the programs involved are slow).
+ 
+ 
+ CLIFF NOTES
+ ------------
+ 
+ The quick version is this:
+ 
+ 	Use "unrm" to recover the data, from the file system with
+ 	the lost file, to another file system; run lazarus, and
+ 	comb through the results until you find your data.
+ 
+ 
+ UNABRIDGED VERSION
+ -------------------
+ 
+ OK, you have the will, the time, and the disk space.  What now?
+ Reconstructing data is a two step process - recovering the data from
+ the unallocated section of the media with unrm and then reconstructing
+ it with lazarus.  You might try to read the man pages for unrm & lazarus,
+ or the file "lazarus.README", which will go on and on about how lazarus
+ and unrm work.  Failing that, this is a perhaps kindler and gentler
+ approach to the problem.
+ 
+ 
+ #1.  Determine the file system the lost file was on.  For those not
+ 	familiar with this concept, try typing (the "%" is the prompt -
+ 	"#" is used when it must be done by root):
+ 
+ 		% df /directory/where/file/was
+ 
+ 	("/bin/df -k" or "/usr/ucb/df" for solaris users)
+ 
+ This will return something like:
+ 
+ 	Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
+ 	/dev/sda1              1008872    246788    710836  26% /
+ 
+ (Note - the "available column actually lies.  It has about 10% *MORE* than 
+ this available.  This is because Unix keeps a bit of space (typically 10% of 
+ the drive's capacity) in reserve (writable only by root) for performance 
+ and safety reasons.)
+ 
+ The first column ("/dev/sda1" in this case), is what we're interested in.
+ With the mantra "you need 220% of the free space available somewhere else"
+ in mind, if you have this 1GB disk with 710MB free, you'd want a second 
+ disk with at least 710MB x 220%, or some 1.6 GB free. If that space
+ is not available locally, perhaps you can find a machine elsewhere
+ on the network that has the space.
+ 
+ 
+ #2.  Save the unallocated blocks of that Filesystem - use the "unrm" tool
+ for this.  This may sound foolish, but UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU 
+ RECOVER DATA TO THE SAME FILE SYSTEM IT WAS LOST ON!!!!  If this isn't 
+ clear to you, consider; your data is in that free area out there somewhere.
+ You'd be filling up that free space with itself, essentially at random 
+ locations.  There'd be a more than significant chance you'd blow away your 
+ lost file before you got it.
+ 
+ Anyway, let's say you have two file systems, /dev/sda1 & /dev/sda2,
+ and you want to recover a file from the first.  As root you would...
+ 
+ 	a) Decide where on /dev/sda2 that you'll keep the results of
+ 	   the experiment.  I'll call this "/path/to/TCT" (for simplicity,
+ 	   this is also where TCT is installed).
+ 
+ 	b) type:
+ 
+ 		% cd /path/to/TCT
+ 
+ 	   and:
+ 
+ 		% bin/unrm /dev/sda1  >  /path/to/TCT/unrm_ouput
+ 
+ You'll probably need to wait several minutes, depending on how big the
+ disk is that you're unrm'ing from.
+ 
+ That's it, you've recovered your file!  Well, if it was on the disk
+ it's in that big file you just created ("/path/to/TCT/unrm_ouput").
+ You can, if you wish, try to scrounge through that binary thing to
+ recover your data.  Or you can move on to #3.
+ 
+ 
+ #3.  Run Lazarus on the output of unrm.  Typically this is done like:
+ 
+ 	% bin/lazarus -h unrm_output
+ 
+ The -h flag generates HTML output, which we can view with a browser.
+ Lazarus splits that big binary file into many smaller chunks.  It creates
+ two directories, one of which is called "blocks" and has *lots* of files
+ in it.  Hopefully your data is in there.
+ 
+ 
+ #4.  Now the hard part.  If you know what your file looks like, and it
+ has some unusual words or something in it, then you can try method A.
+ If not, go to method B below.
+ 
+ Method A
+ ---------
+ 
+ Let's say you lost a the last letter that your Dad wrote to you before
+ he died, and all you really remember is that he wrote something about a
+ Studebaker automobile he had as a kid.  "Studebaker" is a great word to
+ search for because the odds are that not a lot of files have that word
+ in it.
+ 
+ So you use your best friend "grep" on the blocks that were saved:
+ 
+ 	% grep -il studebaker blocks/* > matching_files
+ 
+ (-i ignores case, -l lists the file names)
+ 
+ If you see a match, examine the file(s) listed with a good pager that
+ can handle binary data, such as "less".  If you find it, congrats!
+ 
+ The above approach may fail with an error like "Argument list too
+ long" when there are many files. In that case, try the more robust
+ but more verbose version:
+ 
+ 	% find blocks -type f -print | xargs grep -il studebaker >matching_files
+ 
+ If you're looking for something that isn't so unique, think of keywords
+ that might help you out (like your name, employers, etc.)  You could
+ then do something like:
+ 
+ 	% egrep -il 'keyword1|keyword2|...' blocks/*.txt > matching_files
+ 
+ Images are likewise easy to examine; simply do something like ("xv" is a 
+ fine Unix image viewer/editor, "gimp" and others can also be used):
+ 
+ 	% xv blocks/*.gif blocks/*.jpg
+ 
+ Text based log files (syslog, message, etc.), even though they will 
+ often be spread out all over the disk because of the way they are written
+ (a few records at a time), are actually potentially easy to recover -
+ and in the correct order - because of the wonderful time stamp on each
+ line; the simplest way (until a better log analyzer is written) is to
+ (the tr(1) is in there to remove nulls; commands such as sort don't
+ like nulls in the files they work with!):
+ 
+ 	% cat blocks/*.l.txt | tr -d '\000' | sort -u > all-logs
+ 
+ And then browse through them.  A few bits and pieces will probably
+ be lost (due to the fragmentation at block and fragment boundaries),
+ but it's a good way to start.
+ 
+ Some data, like C source code, is very easy to confuse with other
+ types of program files and text, so a combined arms approach that
+ uses grep & the browser is sometimes useful (more on the browser 
+ approach in a bit).
+ 
+ Another good way to find source code is if you know of a specific #include
+ file that the code uses or a specific output line that the program emits -
+ a simple:
+ 
+ 	% grep -l rpcsvc/sm_inter.h blocks/*.[cpt].txt
+ 
+ Will find any files that have rpcsvc/sm_inter.h in them (not a lot,
+ probably! ;-))	This sort of brute force approach can be quite useful.
+ 
+ Again, beware of concatenating lots of recovered blocks/files
+ together and performing text based searches or operations on them
+ (sort, grep, uniq, etc.)
+ 
+ 
+ Method B
+ ---------
+ 
+ Browsin' time.  The browser approach, while much nicer looking, is
+ not so great when you're looking for that one lost file. However,
+ a browser can be helpful when you're looking for interesting files
+ in general.  To start up the browser just have it open up the main
+ HTML file you created previously with lazarus - it'll have a name
+ like "unrm_output.frame.html" if the original data was called
+ "unrm_output".
+ 
+ If done correctly you'll see large map of your disk made up from
+ letters, and a small HTML frame that shows what all the letters in
+ the large map mean.  You can use your browser's internal search
+ function or simply browse through the map looking for things of
+ interest.  Clicking on a link will display the data in that file
+ (unless it has unprintable data).
+ 
+ Some data - like C source code - is hard for lazarus to distinguish
+ from other types of program files and text, so a combined arms approach 
+ that uses grep & the browser can be useful.  For instance, if you
+ have a section of data that looks like thus on the disk map:
+ 
+ 	....CccPpC..Hh....
+ 
+ The first three recognized text types - C, P, and C - might all be
+ the same type of text (C).  Finding the block # by simply putting
+ your mouse over the link and then concatenating the files or
+ examining them manually is great.
+ 
+ The browser based approach can be especially useful if you have 
+ lots of files on a disk.  Because Unix file systems often will have a
+ strong sense of locality that is tied to the directories that the
+ files were once in, you can use the graphical browser to locate
+ an interesting looking section of the disk and try to hunt either
+ using the browser or via standard Unix tools on the saved blocks
+ once you've found an area that looks promising.
+ 
+ 
+ As you can see (if you've read this far), this is *far* from being
+ an automated process.  However, you really can recover stuff.  In the
+ future the process will hopefully become less arduous, either if we
+ put some of the features we've been thinking about (being able to search
+ from the browser, displaying all data irrespective of its printability,
+ etc.) or if others work on this important problem.
+ 
+ Good luck recovering your data!
