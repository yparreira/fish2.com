<p>Definitions:</p>

<p>"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification, or segments thereof.</p>

<p>"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,
or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright
Holder.</p>

<p>"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for
the package.</p>

<p>"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
Package.</p>

<p>"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media
cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not
be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)</p>

<p>"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that
recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
received it.</p>

<p>1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.</p>

<p>2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.</p>

<p>3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when
AND WHY you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:</p>

<blockquote>
  a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
  Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
  equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
  such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
  modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

  <p>b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
  organization.</p>

  <p>c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
  standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide separate
  documentation for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how
  it differs from the Standard Version.</p>

  <p>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</p>
</blockquote>
4) You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

<blockquote>
  a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
  together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to
  get the Standard Version.

  <p>b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
  Package with your modifications.</p>

  <p>c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
  Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
  non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages
  (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard
  Version.</p>

  <p>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</p>
</blockquote>
5) You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. YOU
MAY NOT CHARGE A FEE FOR THIS PACKAGE ITSELF. However, you may distribute
this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part
of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that YOU DO
NOT ADVERTISE this package as a product of your own.

<p>6) The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written
permission.</p>

<p>7) THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
