Descriptions as to what each module does:</h1></center>
<b>Titan top level directory. This directory exists because of so many
subtle changes done to different Linux distros. It just got too messy to
keep all Linux modules in one place.</b>
<center>
<p><a NAME="418052"></a></center>
<a href="Titan-Config">Titan-Config</a> This script&nbsp; figures
out which OS you are using and makes the appropriate links to the shell
scripts accordingly. Titan-Config also asks if you want to&nbsp; make a
backup directory of all files modified by Titan. <blink><font color="#CC0000">NOTE:
</font></blink>backup
(backtit.sh) now backs up /etc/shadow and other important system files.
It is important that these files be kept safe (we chmod them to 600; but
that is not enough if titan lives on an NFS mount or other insecure location)
<p><a href="arch/sol8sun4/bin/Titan">Titan</a>&nbsp; Titan is the
program which runs all the other shell scripts (*.sh) and accepts either
the -I (intro) -F (fix) -C (configuration) [ + filename] )or -V (verify)
flag.
<p>MinimizeOS is a new module that takes a configuration file and does
a pkgrm of all modules that are not found in the configuration file. This
minimizes the OS and removes unused (and potentially insecure) packages
from the system.Use with caution.
<p><a href="arch/sol8sun4/bin/Titan.top">Titan.top </a>This module
is the same as Titan except the path has been modified so that When "Titan-Config"
is run, Titan can be run from the top most directory.
<p><a href="arch/fbsd/bin/TitanReport">TitanReport</a>. This
file runs all Titan modules in the $TITANDIR/bin/modules directory using
the "-v" flag. TitanReport then sends email with&nbsp; the results. Titanreport
is intended to run out of cron, or as an auditing tool. See the<a href="FAQ.html">
FAQ</a> for more.
<p><a href="arch/fbsd/lib/backtit.sh">backtit.sh </a>This modules
is called by "Titan-Config" when run "Titan-Config -i" (install). Backtit.sh
makes a backup copy of all the files Titan modifies (backtit.sh currently
does not backup file permission changes) SEE Note above!
<p><a href="arch/fbsd/lib/untit.sh">untit.sh</a> Untit.sh is
called by "Titan-Config" when run 'Titan-Config -d" (de-install) Untit.sh
replaces the files modified by Titan with the original unsecured versions,
and is provided as a recovery mechanism if we were too aggressive about
securing the system.
<p><b>src1 directory</b>
<p><a href="../../src1/noshell.c">noshell.c</a> This is the preferred way
of doing a noshell. This should be statically compiled (see <a href="../../src1/makefile">Titan.v4.0/src1/Makefile.linux</a>)
and should replace the shell script that disable-accounts.sh placed in
/usr/sbin/noshell.
<p><a href="../../src1/noshell-simple.c">noshell-simple.c</a> This is a
simplified version of noshell.c . I don't expect this to get much use,
but&nbsp; should be statically compiled (see <a href="../../src1/Makefile">Titan,v4.0/src1/Makefile</a>)
and replace the /usr/sbin/noshell script that disable-accounts.sh creates.
the script that disable-accounts.sh creates is better than nothing,&nbsp;
(better than /bin/true which is also a shell script) but a statically linked
C program is the best way to go.
<p><a href="../../src1/Makefile.fbsd">Titan,v4.0/src1/Makefile.fbsd</a>It
turned out that with a few simple changes to the makefile, that noshell
and runas worked fine with Linux distributions (probably other Unix variants
too).
<p><a href="../../src1/runas.c">runas.c</a> This is a simple generic program
that allows administrators to start daemons as non privileged users, and
optionally to run in a chrooted environment. A really good example is the
license manager daemon. Sun sets the license manager daemon (in /etc/rc2.d/S85lmgrd)
to start up with the command (line 84 on my system) :
<p>su nobody -c $lic_srvr_start
<p>This isn't bad, but it requires that the user shell for user "nobody"
be a valid shell. Well being paranoid, Titan sets the shell to "noshell"
so when some intruder tries to login as user "nobody" we get a warning
message. So to get the license manager daemon to start, while keeping our
security intact, we change the /etc/rc2.d/S86lmgrd to use runas with the
following syntax:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; /sbin/runas 60001 60001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 022 $lic_srvr_start
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
^^^^^&nbsp; ^^^^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^^^
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nobodyUID&nbsp;
nobodyGID&nbsp;&nbsp; umask to use
<p>viola! Secure as well as functional. With the latest runas.c you can
also run things in a chrooted environment. This isn't required for the
license manager daemon, but will come in handy for http daemons.
<p>&nbsp;
<p><b>Titan modules (arch/RedHat/bin/modules)</b>
<p><a href="arch/fbsd/bin/modules/create-issue.sh">create.issue.sh</a>
Creates the /etc/issue banner that gets displayed at login time.
<p><a href="arch/fbsd/bin/modules/ftpusers.sh">ftpusers.sh</a>
Creates a sane /etc/ftpusers which stops users such as root or "bin" from
using ftp. This prevents "root" from ftping over a new /etc/shadow file,
and forces the administrators to ftp as themselves and then "su" to root
thus keeping the audit trail&nbsp; (more) intact.
<p><a href="arch/fbsd/bin/modules/inetd.sh">inetd.sh</a> Changes
/etc/inetd.conf&nbsp; and turns off most of the services.&nbsp; You will
want to&nbsp; localize this.&nbsp; For desktops for instance you might
want to leave on the services for calendar manager and tooltalk (assuming
windows) My suggestion is to get tcp_wrappers and wrap all services. Then
get ssh and turn off rsh/rlogin and ftp and only use ssh/scp for remote
access needs.
<p><a href="arch/fbsd/bin/modules/inetd_flags.sh">inetd_flags.sh</a>
<p>&nbsp;This program copies /etc/inetd.conf to /etc/inetd.conf.ORIG-DATE.
<p>&nbsp;Then makes an addition to /etc/rc.conf to increase the number
of times a
<p>&nbsp;service can be invoked in one minute.(the default is 256- 1024
sounds more
<p>&nbsp;reasonable adjust as needed)
<p>&nbsp;change RATE=1024 to adjust number of times service can be invoked.
<p>&nbsp;NOTE: This changes inetd_flags, if you have existing flags that
you
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want to keep, make changes
to script as needed.
<p>l<a href="arch/fbsd/bin/modules/log_in_vain.sh">og_in_vain.sh</a>&nbsp;
This program copies /etc/inetd.conf to /etc/inetd.conf.ORIG-DATE.
<p>&nbsp; Then makes an addition to /etc/rc.conf to log all connection
attempts to
<p>&nbsp; TCP/UDP ports with out services running on them.
<p><a href="arch/fbsd/bin/modules/nuke-inetd.sh">nuke-inetd.sh</a>
<p>&nbsp;Use this module with caution, all inetd network services will
be
<p>&nbsp;disabled.
<p>&nbsp;This program copies /etc/inetd.conf to /etc/inetd.conf.ORIG-DATE.&nbsp;
Then makes an
<p>&nbsp;addition to /etc/rc.conf to turn off inetd&nbsp; from starting
at startup.
<p><a href="arch/fbsd/bin/modules/nuke-portmap.sh">nuke-portmap.sh</a>
<p>Use this module with caution.
<p>&nbsp;This program copies /etc/inetd.conf to /etc/inetd.conf.ORIG-DATE.&nbsp;
Then makes an
<p>&nbsp;addition to /etc/rc.conf to turn off portmapper from starting
at startup.
<p><a href="arch/fbsd/bin/modules/nuke-sendmail.sh">nuke-sendmail.sh</a>
This module does as it implies. Disables sendmail. This modules should
be used on Firewalls that are not sendmail servers, Servers that are not
sendmail servers, and all desktops that have their mail delivered to a
server.
<p><a href="arch/fbsd/bin/modules/telnet-banner.sh">telnet-banner.sh</a>
<p>This program copies /etc/hosts.allow to /etc/hosts.allow.ORIG
<p>&nbsp;and modifies the runtime /etc/hosts.allow so that the following
<p>&nbsp;tcp services will present a pre-login banner.
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;tcp banner&nbsp; services include:
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; telnetd ftpd rlogind
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;NOTE: Important -> this overrides existing host.allow filters!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To place your access filters
in this script change filter entry.
<p>&nbsp;Should you need to change this vi this script and modify the
<p>&nbsp;\$ServiceList variable to include/exclude as you wish....
