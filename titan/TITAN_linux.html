<h1>
Descriptions as to what each module does:</h1></center>
<b>Titan top level directory. This directory exists because of so many
subtle changes done to different Linux distros. It just got too messy to
keep all Linux modules in one place.</b>
<center>
<p><a NAME="418052"></a></center>
<a href="Titan-Config">Titan-Config</a> This script&nbsp; figures
out which OS you are using and makes the appropriate links to the shell
scripts accordingly. Titan-Config also asks if you want to&nbsp; make a
backup directory of all files modified by Titan. <blink><font color="#CC0000">NOTE:
</font></blink>backup
(backtit.sh) now backs up /etc/shadow and other important system files.
It is important that these files be kept safe (we chmod them to 600; but
that is not enough if titan lives on an NFS mount or other insecure location)
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/Titan">Titan</a>&nbsp; Titan is the
program which runs all the other shell scripts (*.sh) and accepts either
the -I (intro) -F (fix) -C (configuration) [ + filename] )or -V (verify)
flag.
<p>MinimizeOS is a new module that takes a configuration file and does
a pkgrm of all modules that are not found in the configuration file. This
minimizes the OS and removes unused (and potentially insecure) packages
from the system.Use with caution.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/Titan.top">Titan.top </a>This module
is the same as Titan except the path has been modified so that When "Titan-Config"
is run, Titan can be run from the top most directory.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/TitanReport">TitanReport</a>. This
file runs all Titan modules in the $TITANDIR/bin/modules directory using
the "-v" flag. TitanReport then sends email with&nbsp; the results. Titanreport
is intended to run out of cron, or as an auditing tool. See the<a href="FAQ.html">
FAQ</a> for more.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/sample.Desktop">Sample.Desktop</a>,
<a href="arch/RedHat/bin/sample.Firewall">sample.Firewall</a>,
<a href="arch/RedHat/bin/sample.Server">sample.Server</a>,
<a href="arch/RedHat/bin/sample.config">sample.config.</a>
These files are used as sample templates when titan is run as "Titan -c
config-file". See the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> for more.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/lib/backtit.sh">backtit.sh </a>This modules
is called by "Titan-Config" when run "Titan-Config -i" (install). Backtit.sh
makes a backup copy of all the files Titan modifies (backtit.sh currently
does not backup file permission changes) SEE Note above!
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/lib/untit.sh">untit.sh</a> Untit.sh is
called by "Titan-Config" when run 'Titan-Config -d" (de-install) Untit.sh
replaces the files modified by Titan with the original unsecured versions,
and is provided as a recovery mechanism if we were too aggressive about
securing the system.
<p><b>src1 directory</b>
<p><a href="../../src1/noshell.c">noshell.c</a> This is the preferred way
of doing a noshell. This should be statically compiled (see <a href="../../src1/makefile">Titan.v4.0/src1/Makefile.linux</a>)
and should replace the shell script that disable-accounts.sh placed in
/usr/sbin/noshell.
<p><a href="../../src1/noshell-simple.c">noshell-simple.c</a> This is a
simplified version of noshell.c . I don't expect this to get much use,
but&nbsp; should be statically compiled (see <a href="../../src1/Makefile">Titan,v4.0/src1/Makefile</a>)
and replace the /usr/sbin/noshell script that disable-accounts.sh creates.
the script that disable-accounts.sh creates is better than nothing,&nbsp;
(better than /bin/true which is also a shell script) but a statically linked
C program is the best way to go.
<p><a href="../../src1/Makefile.linux">Titan,v4.0/src1/Makefile.linux</a>
It turned out that with a few simple changes to the makefile, that noshell
and runas worked fine with Linux distributions (probably other Unix variants
too).
<p><a href="../../src1/runas.c">runas.c</a> This is a simple generic program
that allows administrators to start daemons as non privileged users, and
optionally to run in a chrooted environment. A really good example is the
license manager daemon. Sun sets the license manager daemon (in /etc/rc2.d/S85lmgrd)
to start up with the command (line 84 on my system) :
<p>su nobody -c $lic_srvr_start
<p>This isn't bad, but it requires that the user shell for user "nobody"
be a valid shell. Well being paranoid, Titan sets the shell to "noshell"
so when some intruder tries to login as user "nobody" we get a warning
message. So to get the license manager daemon to start, while keeping our
security intact, we change the /etc/rc2.d/S86lmgrd to use runas with the
following syntax:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; /sbin/runas 60001 60001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 022 $lic_srvr_start
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
^^^^^&nbsp; ^^^^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^^^
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nobodyUID&nbsp;
nobodyGID&nbsp;&nbsp; umask to use
<p>viola! Secure as well as functional. With the latest runas.c you can
also run things in a chrooted environment. This isn't required for the
license manager daemon, but will come in handy for http daemons.
<p>&nbsp;
<p><b>Titan modules (arch/RedHat/bin/modules)</b>
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/add-umask.sh">add-umask.sh&nbsp;</a>
Adds system wide umasks for rc?.d files causing system daemon to create
more secure files; (From Casper Dik's code.)
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/adjust-arp-timers.sh">adjust-arp-timers.sh</a>&nbsp;
This changes the system configuration to shorten the ARP expiration timer&nbsp;
to one minute instead of the default 20 minutes.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/atset.sh">atset.sh</a> This script
checks/puts CRONLOG=YES in /etc/default/cron,
<p>changes the permissions of /var/cron so that the users cannot
<p>peek in the cron log file (it seems the file is created with 600
<p>perms anyhow, but one never knows), and modifies /etc/cron.daily/logchecker
<p>to rotate the log files at 2MB file size.
<p>For linux this creates /etc/cron.allow and adds only root by default.
<p>All other local password accounts are added to /etc/cron.deny.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/create-issue.sh">create.issue.sh</a>
Creates the /etc/issue banner that gets displayed at login time.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/cronset.sh">cronset.sh.</a>
This script check/fixes CRONLOG-YES in /etc/default/cron, rotates the cron
log files at 2Mb, and changes cron permissions.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/decode.sh">decode.sh </a>Looks
for any&nbsp; ``|'' in /etc/aliases and fixes if found.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/disable-accounts.sh">disable-accounts.sh</a>
Disables ``system'' accounts like ``bin'' and ``daemon'' and creates a
/usr/sbin/noshell script. The noshell script should only be a place holder
until you compile and install the noshell&nbsp; statically linked C program.
NOTE: if you don't have a root password set, titan WILL disable root as
well.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/duplicate-root.sh">duplicate-root.sh</a>&nbsp;
Check for extra root accounts.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/file-own.sh">file-own.sh</a>
Changes system files (mainly in /usr ) to be owned by "root"." I personally
don't like anything that the root user is going to run not being owned
by root. When /usr/bin is owned by user ``bin'' user ``bin can trojan anything
root runs; thus bin=root. Thus I change everything back to root to begin
with. We need not mention NFS where root=nobody but bin=bin; I think you
get the point.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/fix-cronpath.sh">fix-cronpath.sh</a>
Changes permission and ownership of things run out of roots cron.&nbsp;
Otherwise every time cron is run a new trojan/setuid-root-file could be
created.
<p><a NAME="418095"></a>
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/ftpaccess_secure.sh">ftpaccess_secure.sh</a>
Changes or creates /etc/ftpaccess file to add in a umask,&nbsp; ftp banner
<p>and restrictions on file transfers. If you are unlucky enough to lose
<p>your root password this change will restrict downloads of any files
named
<p>passwd or shadow, period...
<p>Changes or created /etc/banner for the ftpaccess parser to display an
approriate
<p>warnign message on connection.. Similar to /etc/issue...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This system is for authorized users only. Monitoring
may occur"
<p>&nbsp;
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/ftpusers.sh">ftpusers.sh</a>
Creates a sane /etc/ftpusers which stops users such as root or "bin" from
using ftp. This prevents "root" from ftping over a new /etc/shadow file,
and forces the administrators to ftp as themselves and then "su" to root
thus keeping the audit trail&nbsp; (more) intact.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/hosts.equiv.sh">hosts.equiv.sh</a>
Checks for /etc/hosts.equiv. it should also check /etc/nsswitch.conf "password
and group" entries but currently doesn't.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/inetd.sh">inetd.sh</a> Changes
/etc/inetd.conf&nbsp; and turns off most of the services.&nbsp; You will
want to&nbsp; localize this.&nbsp; For desktops for instance you might
want to leave on the services for calendar manager and tooltalk (assuming
windows) My suggestion is to get tcp_wrappers and wrap all services. Then
get ssh and turn off rsh/rlogin and ftp and only use ssh/scp for remote
access needs.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/inetd2.sh">inetd2.sh</a> A
more restrictive version of the inetd.sh module. This one turns off everything,
and runs a little cleaner for servers.
<p>l<a href="../../arc/RedHat/bin/modules/limit-core-redhat.sh">imit-core-redhat.sh</a>
This changed the /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions file making the core dump
<p>size limited to zero length. This prevents bad-guys forcing a core
dump to examine
<p>any information that might be stored in the core.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/log-tcp.sh">log-tcp.sh </a>Changes
the inet startup configuration to use the "-d" flag
<p>in /etc/rc.d/init.d/inet.
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;From the inetd man page:
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Instructs inetd to trace the incoming&nbsp; connections
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
for all of its TCP services.&nbsp; It does this by log-
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ging the client's IP address and TCP port&nbsp; number,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
along with the name of the service, using the sys-
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
log(3) facility.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/loginlog.sh">loginlog.sh</a>
Fixes the syntax so that log entries are made for failed login attempts.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/lpsched.sh">lpsched.sh</a>
Disables lp. For firewalls, and non-print servers. Probably want to leave
this service on for desktops.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/nsswitch.sh">nsswitch.sh</a>&nbsp;
Modifies /etc/nsswitch.conf removing all the nis/nis+/dns entries. This
is useful on a firewall, but you may want to tune it down a little on networked
servers and desktops.&nbsp; It also sets password and group to only look
at local password/group files; again network servers or desktops might
not want this behavior.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/nuke-sendmail.sh">nuke-sendmail.sh</a>
This module does as it implies. Disables sendmail. This modules should
be used on Firewalls that are not sendmail servers, Servers that are not
sendmail servers, and all desktops that have their mail delivered to a
server.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/pam-rhosts.sh">pam-rhosts.sh</a>
This saves and modifies the /etc/pam.conf file removing the line: " rlogin&nbsp;
auth sufficient /usr/lib/security/pam_rhosts_auth.so.1" such that rhosts
are not allowed by the PAM system.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/passwd.sh">passwd.sh</a> Checks
that all accounts have passwords and adds in a "*" password if run in fix
mode.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/psfix.sh">psfix.sh</a>&nbsp;
This program creates /etc/rc3.d/S79tmpfix so that upon boot the /tmp&nbsp;
directory will always have the sticky bit set mode 1777
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/rhosts.sh">rhosts.sh</a> Originally
from COPS. Scans for .rhosts in NIS and local directories but unlike COPS
if run in fix mode it removes/renames them.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/rootchk.sh">rootchk.sh</a>
Checks roots path and makes sure that root owns the directories and binaries
in roots path. Changes them (when run -F) if they are wrong. Also removes
the ``.'' from the path.
<p><a href="../../arc/RedHat/bin/modules/rootpath.sh">rootpath.sh</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Check root's path for .
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/routed.sh">routed-quiet.sh</a>
Starts in.routed in the quiet mode (-q)
<p>- <font color="#FF0000">Big note here!</font> - REMEMBER to <b>re-run
this</b> whenever you add any patches for in.routed.If you don't, the in.routed
will start up advertising routes agai
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/sendmail-forward.sh">sendmail-forward.sh</a>
Takes advantage of new sendmail features to disable forwarding of mail
(spammers using you to bounce their mail)
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/sendmail.sh">sendmail.sh</a>
changes sendmail.cf adding in the option ``goaway'' so that telnet hostname
25" (connecting to the sendmail port) doesn't allow cracker to look up
user info.&nbsp; Note- you should also changes the P=/bin/sh to P=/bin/false
if you can or look into using smrsh for servers and desktops. Note-&nbsp;
firewalls should&nbsp; TURN OFF/wrapper&nbsp; sendmail on the firewall
system.&nbsp; Now would be a good time to look into Postfix.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/smtpbanner.sh">smtpbanner.sh</a>
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/smtpbanner-8.8.sh">
 </a>Modified
sendmail version 8.8 sendmail.cf to change the banner to give out less
information.
<p>&nbsp;
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/snmpdx.sh">snmpdx.sh</a>
Simply moves aside all the snmpdx daemons start up files. Snmpdx give out
more information than you really want it to. Who needs a port scanner if
snmpdx is running?
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/syslog.sh">syslog.sh</a> Modifies
/etc/syslog.conf so that console messages are also saved to system log
files. Note: For critical systems, you should have at least one remote
system defined as "loghost" in your /etc/hosts (or NIS) so you can do sanity
checks to see if your local logs have been changed/deleted by an intruder.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/telnet-banner.sh">telnet-banner.sh</a>
This module was contributed by Jason R. Rhoads mailto:jasonr@net.com. telnet-banner.sh&nbsp;
sets BANNER="" in /etc/default/telnetd so that the Solaris version is not
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/tftp-disable.sh">tftp-disable.sh</a>
Disables tftp.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/tftpServer.sh">tftpServer.sh</a>
configures tftp to allow specific directories to be tftp'd (for things
like cisco
<p>router or boot servers)
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/ttytab.sh">ttytab.sh</a> This
program checks&nbsp;&nbsp; /etc/securetty to disable b -s problems.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/tune-perm.sh">tune-perm.sh</a>
Runs a modified file permission fixes&nbsp; origionally from Sun'
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patch 100103-12
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tune attributes on file
system objects
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This portion will set file
system object permissions
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to a more secure setting.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/userumask.sh">userumask.sh</a>
Adds in a umask of 022 for users in /etc/skel and /etc files.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/useradd.sh">useraddset.sh</a>&nbsp;
Set up modifications to the default useradd program.
<p><a NAME="418148"></a><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/utmp.sh">utmp.sh
</a>Checks
utmpx just to be sure it isn't world writeable.
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/uucp-disable.sh">uucp-disable.sh</a>&nbsp;
Check login shell for uucp is disabled
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/ypserv-client.sh">ypserver-client.sh</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Check that /etc/passwd on ypserver does not have client line
<p><a href="arch/RedHat/bin/modules/ziplock.sh">ziplock.sh</a>&nbsp;
The final step in tightening - <font color="#FF0000">READ CAREFULLY</font>
-This program absolutely tightens perms for much of the OS. Caution after
this is run ONLY root and group STAFF will be able&nbsp; run many system
functions!!! <b>Not intended to be run on normal systems only those with
strict access rules.</b>
