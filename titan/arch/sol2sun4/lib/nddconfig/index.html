# explain what effect the setting has.

# A '0' indicates false/off.
# A '1' indicates true/on.
#

#
# arp_cleanup_interval
#
#  This option determines the period of time the Address Resolution
#  Protocol (ARP) cache maintains entries. ARP attacks may be effective
#  with the default interval. Shortening the timeout interval should
#  reduce the effectiveness of such an attack.
#  The default value is 300000 milliseconds (5 minutes).
#
ARP_CLEANUP_INTERVAL=60000

#
# ip_forward_directed_broadcasts
#
#  This option determines whether to forward broadcast packets directed
#  to a specific net or subnet, if that net or subnet is directly
#  connected to the machine. If the system is acting as a router, this
#  option can be exploited to generate a great deal of broadcast network
#  traffic. Turning this option off will help prevent broadcast traffic
#  attacks.
#  The default value is 1 (True).
#
IP_FORWARD_DIRECTED_BROADCASTS=0

#
# ip_forward_src_routed
#
#  This option determines whether to forward packets that are source
#  routed. These packets define the path the packet should take instead
#  of allowing network routers to define the path.
#  The default value is 1 (True).
#
IP_FORWARD_SRC_ROUTED=0

#
# ip_ignore_redirect
#
#  This option determines whether to ignore Internet Control Message
#  Protocol (ICMP) packets that define new routes. If the system is
#  acting as a router, an attacker may send redirect messages to alter
#  routing tables as part of sophisticated attack (man in the middle
#  attack) or a simple denial of service.
#  The default value is 0 (False).
#
IP_IGNORE_REDIRECT=1

#
# ip_ire_flush_interval
#
#  This option determines the period of time at which a specific route
#  will be kept, even if currently in use. ARP attacks may be effective
#  with the default interval. Shortening the time interval may reduce
#  the effectiveness of attacks.
#  The default interval is 1200000 milliseconds (20 minutes).
#
IP_IRE_FLUSH_INTERVAL=60000

#
# ip_respond_to_address_mask_broadcast
#
#  This options determines whether to respond to ICMP netmask requests
#  which are typically sent by diskless clients when booting. An
#  attacker may use the netmask information for determining network
#  topology or the broadcast address for the subnet.
#  The default value is 0 (False).
#
IP_RESPOND_TO_ADDRESS_MASK_BROADCAST=0

#
# ip_respond_to_echo_broadcast
#
#  This option determines whether to respond to ICMP broadcast echo
#  requests (ping). An attacker may try to create a denial of service
#  attack on subnets by sending many broadcast echo requests to which all
#  systems will respond. This also provides information on systems that
#  are available on the network.
#  The default value is 1 (True).
#
IP_RESPOND_TO_ECHO_BROADCAST=0

#
# ip_respond_to_timestamp
#
#  This option determines whether to respond to ICMP timestamp requests
#  which some systems use to discover the time on a remote system. An
#  attacker may use the time information to schedule an attack at a
#  period of time when the system may run a cron job (or other time-
#  based event) or otherwise be busy. It may also be possible predict
#  ID or sequence numbers that are based on the time of day for spoofing
#  services.
#  The default value is 1 (True).
#
IP_RESPOND_TO_TIMESTAMP=0

#
# ip_respond_to_timestamp_broadcast
#
#  This option determines whether to respond to ICMP broadcast timestamp
#  requests which are used to discover the time on all systems in the
#  broadcast range. This option is dangerous for the same reasons as 
#  responding to a single timestamp request. Additionally, an attacker
#  may try to create a denial of service attack by generating many
#  broadcast timestamp requests.
#  The default value is 1 (True).
#
IP_RESPOND_TO_TIMESTAMP_BROADCAST=0

#
# ip_send_redirects
#
#  This option determines whether to send ICMP redirect messages which
#  can introduce changes into remote system's routing table. It should
#  only be used on systems that act as routers.
#  The default value is 1 (True).
#
IP_SEND_REDIRECTS=0

#
# ip_strict_dst_multihoming
#
#  This option determines whether to enable strict destination
#  multihoming. If this is set to 1 and ip_forwarding is set to 0, then
#  a packet sent to an interface from which it did not arrive will be
#  dropped. This setting prevents an attacker from passing packets across
#  a machine with multiple interfaces that is not acting a router.
#  The default value is 0 (False).
#
IP_STRICT_DST_MULTIHOMING=1

#
# tcp_conn_req_max_q0
# 
#  This option determines the size of the queue containing half-open
#  connections. This setting provides protection from SYN flood attacks.
#  Solaris 2.6 and 7 (and 2.5.1 with patch 103582-12 and higher) include
#  protection from these attacks. The queue size default is adequate for
#  most systems but should be increased for busy Web servers.
#  The default value is 1024.
#
TCP_CONN_REQ_MAX_Q0=4096
