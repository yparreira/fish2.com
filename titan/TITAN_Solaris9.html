Descriptions as to what each module does:</h1></center>
<b>Titan top level directory. This directory exists because of so many
subtle changes done to solaris 9 syntax, and new solaris 9 features. It
just got too messy to keep solaris 2.[1-7] modules and still put in the
solaris 9 functionality.</b>
<center>
<p><a NAME="418052"></a></center>
<a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/Titan">Titan&nbsp;</a> Titan is the program
which runs all the other shell scripts (*.sh) and accepts either the -I
(intro) -F (fix) -C (configuration) [ + filename] )or -V (verify) flag.
<p><a href="../../arch/minumize-OS/minimizeOS.sh">MinimizeOS</a> is a new
module that takes a configuration file and does a pkgrm of all modules
that are not found in the configuration file. This minimizes the OS and
removes unused (and potentially insecure) packages from the system.Use
with caution.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/init4.sh-generic">init4.sh-generic</a>
<br>This script checks and turns off ALL server side services. init4.sh-generic
creates a new system run level of run-level 4 which only has client side
network services enabled.
<p>&nbsp;init4.sh-generic when run the first time with init4.sh-generic
-f;&nbsp; will create links for all start up
<br>&nbsp;scripts from /etc/rc2.d and /etc/rc3.d into the new /etc/rc4.d
and replaces the&nbsp; "S" for "Start" with a "K" for kill in front of
the script to keep the script from running when run-level 4 is entered.
<br>This is done such that by either booting into run-level 4 or by changing
run-level from another run-level into run-level 4 (entering "init 4" as
root) will cause all server side services to be shut down. This includes
inetd! as well as any other services run out of inetd including telnetd,
ftpd, and any other daemon ("*d") that is a listening server for your system.
This makes your system act as
<br>a (mostly) standalone black-box which allows outbound connections,
but does not accept ANY in-bound connections from "standard" services.
<p>&nbsp;NOTE: This does *not* disable any services that are started up
by any other method such as by users or root from the command line, or
via cron.
<p>&nbsp;This utility is quite useful for laptops or other desktop systems
that are going to connect to the Internet temporarily. It is also useful
as a starting point for Servers where you want to manually install a single
service (after running init4.sh-generic -f).
<p>&nbsp;You can manually add back in a startup script (like /etc/rc4.d/S99sshd
or
<br>&nbsp;/etc/rc4.d/httpd) by editing the init4.sh-generic script and
changing the NEEDEDSVC
<br>&nbsp;variable (or just do it manually) . This would then be the only
listening service/server; everything else would not listen for remote connections.
<p>&nbsp;It checks the following directories
<br>&nbsp;/etc/rc2.d /etc/rc3.d
<p>&nbsp;NOTE2: To make init run level 4 the DEFAULT run level for the
system, change the line in /etc/inittab:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Default Solaris uses run
level 3:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is:3:initdefault:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHANGE this line&nbsp; -after-
running the init4.sh-generic script:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TO:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is:4:initdefault:
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/Titan.top">Titan.top </a>This module
is the same as Titan except the path has been modified so that When "Titan-Config"
is run, Titan can be run from the top most directory.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/TitanReport">TitanReport</a>. This
file runs all Titan modules in the $TITANDIR/bin/modules directory using
the "-v" flag. TitanReport then sends email with&nbsp; the results. Titanreport
is intended to run out of cron, or as an auditing tool. See the<a href="FAQ.html">
FAQ</a> for more.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/sample.Desktop">Sample.Desktop</a>,
<a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/sample.Firewall">sample.Firewall</a>,
<a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/sample.Server">sample.Server</a>,
<a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/sample.config">sample.config.</a>
These files are used as sample templates when titan is run as "Titan -c
config-file". See the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> for more.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/lib/backtit.sh">backtit.sh </a>This modules
is called by "Titan-Config" when run "Titan-Config -i" (install). Backtit.sh
makes a backup copy of all the files Titan modifies (backtit.sh currently
does not backup file permission changes) SEE Note above!
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/lib/untit.sh">untit.sh</a> Untit.sh is
called by "Titan-Config" when run 'Titan-Config -d" (de-install) Untit.sh
replaces the files modified by Titan with the original unsecured versions,
and is provided as a recovery mechanism if we were too aggressive about
securing the system.
<p><b>src1 directory</b>
<p><a href="../../src1/noshell.c">noshell.c</a> This is the preferred way
of doing a noshell. This should be statically compiled (see <a href="../../src1/makefile">Titan.v4.0/src1/Makefile</a>)
and should replace the shell script that disable-accounts.sh placed in
/usr/sbin/noshell.
<p><a href="../../src1/noshell-simple.c">noshell-simple.c</a> This is a
simplified version of noshell.c . I don't expect this to get much use,
but&nbsp; should be statically compiled (see <a href="../../src1/Makefile">Titan,v4.0/src1/Makefile</a>)
and replace the /usr/sbin/noshell script that disable-accounts.sh creates.
the script that disable-accounts.sh creates is better than nothing,&nbsp;
(better than /bin/true which is also a shell script) but a statically linked
C program is the best way to go.
<p><a href="../../src1/Makefile.linux">Titan,v4.0/src1/Makefile.linux</a>
It turned out that with a few simple changes to the makefile, that noshell
and runas worked fine with Linux distributions (probably other Unix variants
too).
<p><a href="../../src1/runas.c">runas.c</a> This is a simple generic program
that allows administrators to start daemons as non privileged users, and
optionally to run in a chrooted environment. A really good example is the
license manager daemon. Sun sets the license manager daemon (in /etc/rc2.d/S85lmgrd)
to start up with the command (line 84 on my system) :
<p>su nobody -c $lic_srvr_start
<p>This isn't bad, but it requires that the user shell for user "nobody"
be a valid shell. Well being paranoid, Titan sets the shell to "noshell"
so when some intruder tries to login as user "nobody" we get a warning
message. So to get the license manager daemon to start, while keeping our
security intact, we change the /etc/rc2.d/S86lmgrd to use runas with the
following syntax:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; /sbin/runas 60001 60001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 022 $lic_srvr_start
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
^^^^^&nbsp; ^^^^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^^^
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nobodyUID&nbsp;
nobodyGID&nbsp;&nbsp; umask to use
<p>viola! Secure as well as functional. With the latest runas.c you can
also run things in a chrooted environment. This isn't required for the
license manager daemon, but will come in handy for http daemons.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Titan modules (arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules)</b>
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/add-cmask.sh">add-cmask.sh&nbsp;</a>

This changes the system configuration to shorten the ARP expiration timer&nbsp;
to one minute instead of the default 20 minutes.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/aset.sh">aset.sh</a> This module
was contributed by Jason R. Rhoads mailto:jasonr@net.com. aset.sh is a&nbsp;
Titan wrapper around the Solaris Automated Security Enhancement Tool (ASET)
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/automount.sh">automount.sh&nbsp;</a>
Disables the automounter at boot time. (old version for compatibility)
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/automount2.sh">automount2.sh.</a>
Moves aside the /etc/rc2.d/S74automount file so that automounter doesn't
start up at boot.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/bsm.sh">bsm.sh</a> bsm.sh verifies
that the Basic Security Module (BSM) is enabled and configures auditing
events by modifying /etc/security/audit_control. Auditing is configured
to log all logins, admin operations (whether or not they succeed), as well
as failures of all types except object attribute access failures. Auditing
flags can be changed by editing this script. Note: When run in Fix mode
and BSM was not previously enabled, it will be neccessary to reboot.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/cde.sh">cde.sh</a> This module
sets up CDE to not allow XDMCP logins from remote. In order to do this
we: 1) Move /usr/dt/config/Xaccess to /usr/dt/config/Xaccess.0701021137
2) Move /etc/dt/config/Xaccess to /etc/dt/config/Xaccess.0701021137 (if
it exists) 3) Replace the Xaccess file with a minimal one 4) chmod the
file to work
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/create-issue.sh">create.issue.sh</a>
Creates the /etc/issue banner that gets displayed at login time. NOTE:
see ssh-banner.sh below. You also need to enable that as well for ssh (new
in Sol9)
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/cronset.sh">cronset.sh.</a>
This script check/fixes CRONLOG-YES in /etc/default/cron, rotates the cron
log files at 2Mb, and changes cron permissions.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/decode.sh">decode.sh </a>Looks
for any&nbsp; ``|'' in /etc/aliases and fixes if found.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/defloginparams.sh">defloginparams.sh</a>
Resets the /etc/default/login parameters to a stricter mode.&nbsp; Variables
are in the script to allow you to match <b><i>your</i></b> security policy
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/defpwparams.sh">defpwparams.sh</a>
Resets the /etc/default/password parameters to be stricter. Variables are
in the script to allow you to match <b><i>your</i></b> security
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-L1-A.sh">disable-L1-A.sh
</a>Solaris
2.6 and newer only. This disables the L1-A or stop-A keyboard sequence
by modifying /etc/default/kbd.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-NFS-2.6.sh">disable-NFS-2.6.sh</a>
This checks that the NFS system port is set as a privileged port. Works
with solaris 2.6 and newer using the new ndd definitions:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ndd /dev/tcp tcp_extra_priv_ports
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ndd /dev/udp udp_extra_priv_ports
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-accounts.sh">disable-accounts.sh</a>
Disables ``system'' accounts like ``bin'' and ``daemon'' and creates a
/usr/sbin/noshell script. NOTE! The noshell script should only be a place
holder until you compile and install the noshell&nbsp; statically linked
C program. NOTE: if you don't have a root password set, titan WILL disable
root as well.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-afbinit.sh">disable-afbinit.sh</a>
Disables the afbinit service from starting. part of the OEM packages.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-cachefs.sh">disable-cachefs.sh</a>
Name change from nuke-cachefs.sh Note: some systems require cachefs to
run. HA systems as one example.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-core-sol8.sh">disable-core-sol8.sh</a>
This modules uses coreadm to disable core files. No reboot is required!
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-ncalogd.sh">disable-flashprom.sh
</a>Disables the flasprom daemon from listening for flashprom updates (from
afar)
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-ifbinit.sh">disable-ifbinit.sh</a>
Disables ifbinit daemon from starting (OEM package)
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-L1-A.sh">disable-L1-A.sh</a>.
Stops the L1-A sequence from being used
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-llc2.sh">disable-llc2.sh</a>
Disables llc2 daemon (OEM package)
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-ncalogd.sh">disable-ncalogd.sh</a>
Disables ncalogd from running (OEM package)
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-ping-echo.sh">disable-ping-echo.sh</a>&nbsp;
This disables ip_respond_to_echo_broadcast so that specific ping crashes
don't work . It also hides the system from some network probe agents that
use broadcast ping to discover hosts to probe.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable_ip_holes.sh">disable_ip_holes.sh</a>
Disables ip_forward ip_forward_directed_broadcasts, ip_source_routed,&nbsp;
and ip_ignore_redirect 1, ect.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-pppd.sh">disable-pppd.sh</a>
Disables PPP daemon. Only needed for&nbsp; dialup.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/disable-services.sh">disable-services.sh</a>
This disables various services from running during startup.&nbsp; By default
it will turn off S73nfs.client ,S74autofs, S80lp, S88sendmail, S71rpc,
S99dtlogin, S28nfs.server, and&nbsp; S76snmpdx.&nbsp; These
<br>default services that are disabled can be changed by editing the DISABLERC
variable in the script.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/2.6dmi.sh">dmi-2.6.sh</a> Simply
moves aside all the dmi daemons start up files. DMI doesn't do any authentication
; allows core dumps and seems to allow you to start up arbitrary services.
It isn't well documented on what it actually does.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/eeprom.sh">eeprom.sh</a>&nbsp;
Check Only. This checks to see if you set an eeprom password ("eeprom security-mode
= command" is recommended; and then move/remove the eeprom command support
from the kernel) If you don't set a eeprom password, a bad guy might set
one for you (eeprom security-mode = full) and then halt your system. Then
since you don't know the password, you cannot reboot (DOS attack)
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/file-own.sh">file-own.sh</a>
Changes system files (mainly in /usr ) to be owned by "root"." I personally
don't like anything that the root user is going to run not being owned
by root. When /usr/bin is owned by user ``bin'' user ``bin can trojan anything
root runs; thus bin=root. Thus I change everything back to root to begin
with. We need not mention NFS where root=nobody but bin=bin; I think you
get the point.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/fix-cronpath.sh">fix-cronpath.sh</a>
Changes permission and ownership of things run out of roots cron.&nbsp;
Otherwise every time cron is run a new trojan/setuid-root-file could be
created.
<p><a NAME="418095"></a>
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/fix-modes.sh">fix-modes.sh</a>
modes.c modes;&nbsp; (From Casper Dik). Fixes all the mode 775 directories
and binaries and changes the ownership to root where needed. The modes.c&nbsp;
may need&nbsp; to be compiled locally.
<p>- <font color="#FF0000">Big note here!</font> - REMEMBER to <b>re-run
this</b> whenever you add packages or patches!! If you don't, the modes
get brain dead again. This should be run (-v) often such as out of cron
or at least after adding any vendor patches. Then run -f as needed.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/fix-stack.sol2.6.sh">fix-stack.sol2.6.sh</a>
Solaris 2.6 has the protect_stack ability built-in as a /etc/system configurable
option. This blocks many of the stack smashing bugs from working.
<p><a href="../..//arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/ftp-2.6_secure.sh">ftp-2.6_secure.sh</a>
This works with Solaris 2.6 and newer version of in.ftpd. It adds in a
umask (UMASK=077) into /etc/default/ftpd, and also creates a short ftp
login warning message by creating /etc/ftp-banner. There is a size limit
imposed on the ftp banner, so if you modify
<br>this script, be cognizant of the length restriction.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Caution</font>
- if you reset the Titan default for UMASK, care should be taken. It is
possible to reset the umask value to a LESS secure mode (letting ftp create
executable binaries or suid binaries would be a <b>bad</b> thing!)
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/ftpusers.sh">ftpusers.sh</a>
Creates a sane /etc/ftpusers which stops users such as root or "bin" from
using ftp. This prevents "root" from ftping over a new /etc/shadow file,
and forces the administrators to ftp as themselves and then "su" to root
thus keeping the audit trail&nbsp; (more) intact.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/hosts.equiv.sh">hosts.equiv.sh</a>
Checks for /etc/hosts.equiv. it should also check /etc/nsswitch.conf "password
and group" entries but currently doesn't.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/hostallow.sh">hostallow.sh</a>
New for solaris 9. NOTE: this only applies to ssh/sshd. See tcp_wrap.sh
for all other services started out of inetd (in.telnetd, ect.)
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/inetd.sh">inetd.sh</a> Changes
/etc/inetd.conf&nbsp; and turns off most of the services.&nbsp; You will
want to&nbsp; localize this.&nbsp; For desktops for instance you might
want to leave on the services for calendar manager and tooltalk (assuming
windows) My suggestion is to turn on tcp_wrappers support with tcp_wrap.sh
and wrap all services. Then get ssh and turn off rsh/rlogin and ftp and
only use ssh/scp for remote access needs.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/inetd2.sh">inetd2.sh</a> A
more restrictive version of the inetd.sh module. This one turns off everything,
and runs a little cleaner for things like firewalls.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/inetsvc.sh">inetsvc.sh</a>.
This modules changes /etc/init.d/inetsvc to a minimum version such that
named (DNS server), multicast, and DHCP are not supported. Obviously if
you are on a DNS server, or a laptop that uses DHCP, you may not want to
run this module. But for everything else, it helps by not allowing the
system to be bothered by these system calls.
<p><a NAME="418928"></a><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/keyserv2.8.sh">keyserv2.9.sh</a>
New in sol9. Changes the keyserv startup /etc/default/keyserv changing
ENABLE_NOBODY_KEYS=YES to ENABLE_NOBODY_KEYS=NO.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/log-tcp.sh">log-tcp.sh
</a>Adds
the "-t" flag to in.inetd startup in /etc/rc2.d/S72inetsvc to trace all
incoming TCP services.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/loginlog.sh">loginlog.sh</a>
Fixes the syntax so that (assuming Sun patches) log entries are made for
failed login attempts.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/login_failed_retries.sh">login_failed_retries.sh
</a>This
program modifies /etc/default/login taking advantage of Solaris 8's RETRIES
variable, which determines the number of failed logins that will be allowed
before login exits.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/lpsched.sh">lpsched.sh</a>
Disables lp. For firewalls, and non-print servers. Probably want to leave
this service on for desktops.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/nddconfig2.8.sh">nddconfig.2.9.sh</a>&nbsp;
Creates /etc/rc2.d/<a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/lib/nddconfig">S70nddconfig</a>
and sets all of the kernel network modules that have to do with security
(that we know of)
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/nfs-portmon.sh">nfs-portmon.sh</a>&nbsp;
Turns on NFS port monitoring for solaris.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/nsswitch.sh">nsswitch.sh</a>&nbsp;
Modifies /etc/nsswitch.conf removing all the nis/nis+/dns entries. This
is useful on a firewall, but you may want to tune it down a little on networked
servers and desktops.&nbsp; It also sets password and group to only look
at local password/group files; again network servers or desktops might
not want this behavior.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/nuke-dtlogin.sh">nuke-dtlogin.sh</a>
This program simply renames S99dtlogin to s99dtlogin so that dtlogin does
not start at system boot.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/nuke-nfs-client.sh">nuke-nfs-client.sh</a>For
systems that don't use NFS, and for NFS servers. Disables NFS client
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/nuke-nfs-serv.sh">nuke-nfs-serv.sh</a>
For desktops and those systems that will never be exporting filesystems.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/nuke-nscd.sh">nuke-nscd.sh</a>&nbsp;
Disables the Name Service Cache Daemon. Useful on firewalls, but may not
apply to desktops.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/nuke-powerd.sh">nuke-powerd.sh
</a>This
program simply renames S85power to s85power so that powerd does not start
at system boot
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/nuke-rpc.sh">nuke-rpc.sh</a>
Just eliminates RPC. Used for Servers and Firewalls.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/nuke-sendmail.sh">nuke-sendmail.sh</a>
This module does as it implies. Disables sendmail. This modules should
be used on Firewalls that are not sendmail servers, Servers that are not
sendmail servers, and all desktops that have their mail delivered to a
server.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/nuke-smc.sh">nuke-smc.sh</a>
This module stops the Sun Management Console from starting.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/2.6-pam-rhosts.sh">pam-rhosts-2.6.sh</a>
This solaris 2.6 module saves and modifies the /etc/pam.conf file removing
the line: " rlogin&nbsp; auth sufficient /usr/lib/security/pam_rhosts_auth.so.1"
such that rhosts are not allowed by the PAM system.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/passwd.sh">passwd.sh</a> Checks
that all accounts have passwords and adds in a "*" password if run in fix
mode.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/powerd2.8.sh">powerd2.8.sh</a>
Checks that the power suspend (/usr/openwin/bin/sys-suspend) can only be
run by the root user.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/psfix.sh">psfix.sh</a>&nbsp;
This program creates /etc/rc3.d/S79tmpfix so that upon boot the /tmp&nbsp;
directory will always have the sticky bit set mode 1777
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/queue-sendmail.sh">queue-sendmail.sh</a>
Changes sendmail to queue mode only. Not much use if you already killed
sendmail above.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/rhosts.sh">rhosts.sh</a> Originally
from COPS. Scans for .rhosts in NIS and local directories but unlike COPS
if run in fix mode it removes/renames them.
<p><a NAME="418129"></a><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/rmmount.sh">rmmount.sh</a>
This module adds in the nosuid option into /etc/rmmount.conf forcing vold
to always mount CD's and floppies with the nosuid option enabled. Not needed
if vold.sh has already disabled vold completely.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/rootchk.sh">rootchk.sh</a>
Checks roots path and makes sure that root owns the directories and binaries
in roots path. Changes them (when run -F) if they are wrong. Also removes
the ``.'' from the path.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/routed.sh">routed.sh</a> Starts
in.routed in the quiet mode (-q)
<p>- <font color="#FF0000">Big note here!</font> - REMEMBER to <b>re-run
this</b> whenever you add any patches for in.routed.If you don't, the in.routed
will start up advertising routes again since titans in.routed will be over
written by the patch.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/sendmail-forward.sh">sendmail-forward.sh</a>
Takes advantage of new sendmail features to disable forwarding of mail
(spammers using you to bounce their mail)
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/sendmail.sh">sendmail.sh</a>
changes sendmail.cf adding in the option ``goaway'' so that telnet hostname
25" (connecting to the sendmail port) doesn't allow cracker to look up
user info.&nbsp; Note- you should also changes the P=/bin/sh to P=/bin/false
if you can or look into using smrsh for servers and desktops. Note-&nbsp;
firewalls should&nbsp; TURN OFF/wrapper&nbsp; sendmail on the firewall
system.&nbsp; Now would be a good time to look into Postfix.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/smtpbanner-8.8.sh">smtpbanner-8.8.sh
</a>Modified
sendmail version 8.8 sendmail.cf to change the banner to give out less
information.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/ssh-banner.sh">ssh-banner.sh</a>
Changes to /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to force ssh to display a banner when
connecting.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/syslog-block-remote.sh">syslog-block-remote.sh</a>
New module. Configures syslog to NOT accept remote calls to your syslogd.
This should be run on all systems that ARE NOT defined as "loghost". Loghost
systems SHOULD NOT run this module. Note: For critical systems you should
have at least one system defiled as "loghost" somewhere in your /etc/hosts
(or NIS;NIS+) such that local logs are also sent to a remote "loghost"
server. This is so you can do a sanity check to see if your local logs
have been erased (intrusion).
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/2.6snmpdx.sh">snmpdx-2.6.sh</a>
2.6snmpdx.sh Simply moves aside all the snmpdx daemons start up files.
Snmpdx give out more information than you really want it to. Who needs
a port scanner if snmpdx is running?
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/sulog.sh">sulog.sh</a> This
script checks for existence of /var/adm/sulog, and whether its permissisons/ownership
are 600 root:sys. It will create the file if it doesn't exist and fix the
permissions/ownership
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/syslog.sh">syslog.sh</a> Modifies
/etc/syslog.conf so that console messages are also saved to system log
files. Note: For critical systems, you should have at least one remote
system defined as "loghost" in your /etc/hosts (or NIS/NIS+) so you can
do sanity checks to see if your local logs have been changed/deleted by
an intruder.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/syslog_failed_logins.sh">syslog_failed_logins.sh</a>
Modifies /etc/default/login taking advantage of SYSLOG_FAILED_LOGINS variable.
If the variable is set to 0, login will log -all- failed login attempts.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/tcp_connection_logging.sh">tcp_connection_logging.sh</a>
This program checks/sets the ENABLE_CONNECTION_LOGGING=YES variable in
<br>&nbsp;/etc/default/inetd which allows for logging of tcp connections.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/tcp-sequence.sh">tcp-sequence.sh</a>&nbsp;
Solaris 2.6 and newer. Changes the TCP initial sequence number generation
parameters to use RFC 1948 sequence number generation, unique-per-connection-ID.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/tcp_wrap.sh">tcp_wrap.sh</a>
This program checks/sets the ENABLE_TCPWRAPPERS=YES variable in
<br>&nbsp;/etc/default/inetd which allows for tcp wrappers support for
all solaris /etc/inetd
<br>&nbsp;services.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/telnet-banner.sh">telnet-banner.sh</a>
This module was contributed by Jason R. Rhoads mailto:jasonr@net.com. telnet-banner.sh&nbsp;
sets BANNER="" in /etc/default/telnetd so that the Solaris version is not
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/tmpfs-fixsize.sh">tmpfs-fixsize.sh</a>
donated module by&nbsp; Joachim.Knoke@germany.sun.com. Checks if /tmp is
a virtual filesystem and if so sets it up to have a size limit. This blocks
some user level DoS type attacks.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/userumask.sh">userumask.sh</a>
Adds in a umask of 022 for users in /etc/skel and /etc files.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/useradd.sh">useraddset.sh</a>&nbsp;
Set up modifications to the default useradd program.
<p><a NAME="418148"></a><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/utmp2.7.sh">utmp2.7.sh
</a>Checks
utmpx just to be sure it isn't world writeable.
<p><a NAME="418150"></a><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/vold.sh">vold.sh</a>&nbsp;
Turns off vold. Vold is not needed on a Firewall and Servers, but might
be left on on desktop systems where users are allowed to mount CD's and
Floppy disks via windowing tools.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/modules/x-nolisten.sh">x-nolisten.sh</a>&nbsp;
New for Solaris 9! Changes the X startup configuration to not listen for
remote X connections, by adding "-nolisten tcp" to the X startup file in
the /usr/dt/config/Xservers file. This does not prevent the X server (cde/gnome)
from running, only prevents remote persons from connecting. FROM: :0 Local
local_uid@console root /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun :0 -nobanner TO: :0 Local
local_uid@console root /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun :0 -nobanner -nolisten tcp

The final step in tightening - <font color="#FF0000">READ CAREFULLY</font>
-This program absolutely tightens perms for much of the OS. Caution after
this is run ONLY root and group STAFF will be able&nbsp; run many system
functions!!! <b>Not intended to be run on normal systems only those with
strict access rules.</b>

<p><b>Optional Modules</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This directory contains some specific case modules, where you don't
want or need to run them except in specific configurations. They are put
into the optional directory just so they don't get run by accident.</center>

<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/optional/anon-ftp.setup.sh">anon-ftp.setup.sh&nbsp;</a>
Straight from the Man page for in.ftpd. Sets up Anonymous ftp area in a
reasonable way. This <b>should NOT</b> be used very often, only on systems
that are supposed to allow anonymous ftp.&nbsp; Titan does not run this
by default.
<p><a href="../../arch/sol9sun4/bin/optional/suid.sh">suid.sh</a> This
is a "check only" module. Run it once, and it will report the number of
setuid binaries on the local file systems. EDIT the script once this number
is known and change "known_suid" variable. On subsequent checks, suid.sh
will check and report any new suid binaries that appear (on local file
systems only). This is meant for audit purposes and possibly for use in
cron. Tripwire is a much better solution, and if suid.sh makes you think
about getting and installing Tripwire then its achieved its purpose.
