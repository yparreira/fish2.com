<a NAME="pgfId=424069"></a>What's New in TITAN 4.1 - Solaris/Linux/others..</h1>

<h3 CLASS="Heading1">
Many of you have asked for a "changes document" to see if its worth loading
newer versions of Titan . Also so your local diffs can be incorporated
better.&nbsp; Well here it is!</h3>

<div CLASS="Heading1">Authors note: If you make local changes to Titan,
think about sending them to us for incorporating into the next release!</div>

<div CLASS="Heading1">Titan isn't a commercial product, and we are happy
to incorporate changes, as long as you don't want to get paid for the contributions,
except maybe in beer.&nbsp; -bpowell
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;


<p><b>4.1</b>
<div CLASS="Heading1">End Beta - mostly bug fixes for runas and disable-NFS-2.6.sh&nbsp; </div>

<div CLASS="Heading1">Changes to deal with gcc versions less than 3.3 for stubs.c&nbsp; </div>
<div CLASS="Heading1">Launched production support through <A HREF="http://titanuser.com"><IMG SRC="new2.gif" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><B><FONT COLOR="#009900">titanuser.com</FONT></B></A><FONT COLOR="red"></FONT>&nbsp; </div>
<div CLASS="Heading1"></div>


<p><b>4.0</b>
<div CLASS="Heading1">BETA6- mostly bug fixes as well as some new modules&nbsp;
for the OEM&nbsp;distribution from Solaris 8 and solaria 9.</div>
<div CLASS="Heading1"></div>


<p CLASS="Heading1">This should be the last BETA release.
<div CLASS="Heading1"></div>


<p CLASS="Heading1">Full Solaris 9 support.
<br>&nbsp;</div>

<div CLASS="Heading1">Update to the lib/nddsvc&nbsp; with IPv6 settings
and a few enhancements for DDoS prevention.
<p>init4.sh-generic ; A new module which will make life easier for DMZ
systems, as well as single service systems.
<p>Added in a bunch of modules (basically 6 new disable-*.sh) for daemons
which have crept into Solaris via the OEM bundled install.
<p>Added a module to enable tcp_wrappers support natively to Solaris 9.
<p>Added a module to enable&nbsp; hosts.allow for Solaris 9 sshd.
<p>Added a module to disable remote X server listening&nbsp; (tcp) for
Linux as well as for Solaris 9. Nmap will now no longer be able to detect
<br>port 600 and port 200 listening, while the local X server is still
running.
<p>Optional SP1 (I hate the name service pack)&nbsp; which can be used
for those who prefer a backup and undo for each module.
<p><b>Bug Fixes</b>
<p><b>Fix1:</b>&nbsp; Fixed a major bug in the Backup module. This one
crept in because of the new service pack, and I missed catching its changes
to the standard
<br>distribution (sorry all!) Answering "Y" to Titan-Config.sh for the
backup all changes now works properly.
<p><b>Fix2:&nbsp; </b>Fixed inetsvc.sh in sol8 and sol9 so that it created
a proper&nbsp; minimum /etc/rc2.d/S72inetsvc
<p><b>Enhancements</b>
<p>Added an enhancement to ftpusers.sh so that no matter which ftpd is
used&nbsp; a /etc/ftpusers file is created (actually I just create /etc/ftpusers
and link
<br>it to /etc/ftpdusers).
<p><b>New modules</b>:</div>

<p><br>See the specific modules for a complete description.
