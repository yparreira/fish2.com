Descriptions as to what each module does.</h1></center>
<a href="Titan-Config">Titan-Config</a> This script&nbsp; figures
out which OS you are using and makes the appropriate links from the topmost
directory to the shell scripts accordingly.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/Titan">Titan</a> Titan runs all the
shell scripts in the $TITANDIR/bin/modules directory that are a) files
and b) executable. Titan accepts the -C (config + [filename]), -I (intro),
-F (fix) or -V (verify) flag.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/Titan.top">Titan.top</a> just a copy
of Titan with the paths changed so that when Titan-Config makes a copy
in the topmost directory things work as intended.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/Titanreport">TitanReport</a> This module
runs all titan modules in the "-verify" mode and sends the results via
e-mail. This is intended to run as a cron job or as a audit utility. See
the<a href="FAQ.html"> FAQ f</a>or more.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/sample.Server">Sample.Server</a>, <a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/sample.config">sample.config</a>
, and <a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/sample.list">sample.list</a>&nbsp;
These files are used as templates for&nbsp; use when running "Titan -c
config-file" . See the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> for more in sample.configs
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/lib/backtit.sh">backtit.sh </a>This modules
is called by "Titan-Config" when run "Titan-Config -i" (install). Backtit.sh
makes a backup copy of all the files Titan modifies (backtit.sh currently
does not backup file permission changes)
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/lib/untit.sh">untit.sh</a> Untit.sh is
called by "Titan-Config" when run 'Titan-Config -d" (deinstall) Untit.sh
replaces the files modified by Titan with the original un-secure versions,
and is provided as a recovery mechanism if we were to aggressive about
securing the system.
<p>&nbsp;<a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/aliases.sh">aliases.sh</a>
aliases.sh goes through /etc/aliases looking for "|" and disabling them
when found.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/decode.sh">decode.sh</a> checks
/etc/aliases for decode alias, and removes it. Separate from aliases.sh
since you may have a different policy for servers and desktops. This one
only removes the decode alias not the other "|" from /etc/aliases.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/duplicate-root.sh">duplicate-root.sh</a>
Checks for any accounts that are uid 0 that are not named "root"
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/hosts-equiv.sh">hosts-equiv.sh</a>
Checks for the infamous "+"&nbsp; in /etc/hosts.equiv
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/inetd.sh">inetd.sh</a> Disables
most all&nbsp; inbound services from /etc/inetd.conf. These daemons give
out information or are potential "denial of service" problems. rexd, ftp,
finger, systat, netstat, rusersd, sprayd, and walld.&nbsp; Modify the chatty
daemons variable to add subtract things you wish to leave running.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/is_root">is_root</a> this is
not intended to be run by users. The other scripts call this as a generic
check for execution as root.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/mkshadow.sh">mkshadow.sh</a>
This script was modified from a script originally written by Scott Leadley.
The script sets up shadowed password files in SunOS. A required piece is
the rpc.pwdauthd either from SunOS C2/BSM package or from the patch containing
rpc.pwdauthd.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/optional">optional directory</a>. This
directory contains two compressed tar files. The first one <a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/optional/noshell.tar.Z">noshell.tar.Z</a>
contains a replacement program for the login shell of non-users such as
"bin" or "lp" This code was written by Michele D. Crabb, and is not a part
of Titan or Titan's License agreement. It is provided here strictly because
I think its a useful program and an enhancement to titan functionality.
The second piece in the optional directory is a <font color="#FF0000">NON-Supported
(by Sun)</font> patch for the SunOS kernel which turns off the forwarding
of source routed packets. The file is called <a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/optional/source-routing-patch.tar.Z">source-routing-patch.tar.Z</a>
for obvious reasons. I originally released this back in 1991 to the firewalls
alias.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/passwd.sh">passwd.sh</a> Check
for accounts with no password
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/rhosts.sh">rhosts.sh</a> Check
for null /.rhosts and of course "+" in /.rhosts
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/rootpath.sh">rootpath.sh</a>
Check root's path for the infamous "."
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/rootchk.sh">rootchk.sh</a>
A more strict version or rootpath.sh. This one also changes any files listed
in roots path to be owned by root. important such that others can't modify
binaries that root may run.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/routed-quiet.sh">routed-quiet.sh</a>
Move /usr/etc/in.routed to /usr/etc/in.routed.asetorigional then build
a wrapper starting routed -q. This is done to be compatible with the ASET
package.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/lib/sanity_check">sanity_check</a> This
isn't intended to be run by users (thus no .sh extension) It is called
by the other scripts to check to make sure scripts are called with at least
one additional argument (-i/-v/-f)
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/tftp-disable.sh">tftp-disable.sh</a>
check that tftpd disabled used for systems that are not Diskless Servers
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/tftpServer.sh">tftpServer.sh</a>
Add secure tftp switch Diskless Workstation Server
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/ttytab.sh">ttytab.sh</a> Fix
ttytab to disable b -s problem
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/tune-perms.sh">tune-perms.sh.</a>
Runs a modified file permission fixes from 100103-12 patch Tune attributes
on file system objects This portion will set file system object permissions
to a more secure setting.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/utmp.sh">utmp.sh</a> Checks
/etc/utmp to ensure its not world writeable.
<p><a href="arch/sol1sun4/bin/modules/uucp-disabled.sh">uucp-disabled.sh</a>
