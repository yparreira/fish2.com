<p><a NAME="417927"></a><b><font size=+1>Abstract</font></b>
<p><a NAME="417929"></a>Titan is a collection of programs, each of which
either fixes or tightens one or more potential security problems with a
particular aspect in the setup or configuration of a Unix system. Conceived
and created by Brad Powell, it was written in Bourne shell, and its simple
modular design makes it trivial for anyone who can write a shell script
or program to add to it, as well completely understand the internal workings
of the system.
<p>Titan does not replace other security tools, but when used in combination
with them it can help make the transformation of a new, out of the box
system into a firewall or security conscious system into a significantly
easier task. In a nutshell, it attempts to help improve the security of
the system it runs on.
<p><b><font size=-1>NOTE - Due to time and access to hardware/software&nbsp;
resource, Titan 4.0 will only run on Solaris, versions 1.1.4 , 2.X, Solaris
8,and Solaris 9.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>Titan version 4.0 BETA6 works with Solaris, Linux,
and Free BSD. These are minimalistic modules for Linux and Free BSD.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>Other than taking the time to create Titan modules
for other systems, there is nothing Sun specific (except for some few modules
that are Solaris feature specific )about Titan that would prevent it working
on other Unix systems.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>Titan version 4.1 works with Solaris, Linux and FreeBSD.
These latest additions work minimally compared to Solaris. AIX,v5.2 port
is completed and in Alpha test now. If you would like to test this prior
to it's availability through this web site please click here <a href="http://www.fish.com/~brad/titan/Titan,v4.2.tar.Z">Titan,v4.2

<b><font size=+1>Introduction</font></b>
<p><a NAME="419104"></a>
<p><a NAME="417939"></a><b><font size=-1>Unix is often, and justifiably,
criticized for being a difficult system that is cantankerous and hard to
secure. Some of the main reasons that a Unix system is typically insecure
include:</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<b><font size=-1>It is nearly infinitely configurable.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font size=-1>Unix can be very complex.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font size=-1>Vendors don't ship systems secured by default.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font size=-1>It can require significant amounts of time, resources,
and expertise to secure.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font size=-1>Once secure (if ever) it will become less secure as time
goes on through usage and the continual flow of new security problems being
discovered in the world.</font></b></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</ul>
<b><font size=-1>Titan can help with all of these problems; its main design
goals are:</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<b><font size=-1>After being run, the system should be more secure than
when we started. Things may be broken, but it should be more secure! The
truth is that most things you do to secure a system are probably not going
to cause a problem. A vendor can't take that chance - but we can. In any
case, we haven't run into anything that Titan has broken, but it certainly
could happen.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font size=-1>Security comes first, right along with functionality.
If Titan has been run at its highest level of security, there will be no
significant configuration security problems that I know of. The system
will not be 100% secure - none are - but it will be pretty darn secure.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font size=-1>Producing a consistent and understandably secure system.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font size=-1>It can help create a programmatically defined technical
aspect of a system or site's security policy.&nbsp; Allow the administrator
to have complete control over what modules in Titan are run - with full
source code and a fair bit of flexibility, it is easy to remove unwanted
security fixes. After all, not everyone wants or needs all the actions
that Titan does.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font size=-1>Titan is easily extended. Shell scripts or other programs
can be placed into Titan's framework, and they will be run alongside all
the other programs. All you need do is build your scripts/code to produce
output that an expects.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font size=-1>To be a useful security tool in the overall security framework.</font></b></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</ul>
<b><font size=-1>Titan does not try to do all the other important things,
like fix bugs, check for poor passwords, install patches, or check for
COPS/Tiger/SATAN-like problems. But there is much more to security than
that! And it is not meant to be run once and forgotten, nor should all
Titan modules be run on all systems. But any system administrators that
are concerned about security should have considered, if not resolved or
fixed, a significant number (if not all) of the problems</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>that Titan covers on their security critical systems.
Titan helps by being systematic about things. No longer do you need to
wonder if you finished applying all your changes. Just run Titan -v and
it will spit out all the things Titan thinks need hardening.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="419161"></a><b><font size=+1>History</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>Anyone working in security or systems administration
who has been been around the Internet for any length of time has done it
- making the same changes, over and over again, to secure a system. Worse
yet, each new OS release would bring tiny, seemingly completely arbitrary
changes that would invalidate prior work. And forget it when a new major
release came out, or you had to work with another operating system altogether!
And between the three of us we've ftp'd Crack, COPS, and other security
programs from the net many thousands of times.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>Eventually it became clear. I was not only making the
same changes to the underlying OS over and over again to secure my system
from attack (the many security exploits and investigations that are saved
on my system make it a target), but also when building various firewall
configurations (which is what I do for a living.) I was making the same
changes over and over again. I started writing Titan almost in self defense
- initially as a simple set of tools for my personal systems, but it also
quickly proved a valuable sanity check for confirming consistency when
building firewalls. Its next natural task was to use it when examining
or auditing a system. Laziness is the best motivation there is - if I had
to type those same commands manually&nbsp; one more time...</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>Analyzing the security of a system is depressing -
the same sets of problems always come up. Worse yet, these problems almost
always can be easily fixed - so why aren't they? Worst of all, these problems
keep coming up; if you don't find them the first time, wait a few months
or a year, and they'll be there then. And it's not Sun - it's NEC,&nbsp;
it's HP, it's IBM,&nbsp; yes, Linux too! It's everyone that has even a
mildly complex system. Yes, even Microsoft.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>So why do these same problems show up over and over
and by different suppliers? Good question. I don't know exactly, but I
do know that having a tool that can help ensure that your systems are consistent
in your organization is a positive step in the right direction. Having
a system consistently adhering to the security policy is perhaps the most
valuable thing you can do to keeping it secure.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>I'm often asked how to tighten down the OS when a firewall
product gets installed. There is a reasonable expectation from the customer
that after the firewall is installed that the system will not be compromised
by an attack that is outside the scope of the firewall product. After all,
aren't firewalls supposed to protect you? You wouldn't say it was okay
to run my business on the Internet unless you could protect me, would you?</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>And it's true - it really is unreasonable to expect
the user, a customer, to understand all, or even most (any? ;^}), of the
security issues of running a system on the Internet. Why should they? Security
isn't the goal of a business, making money is. However, this does place
both the firewall vendor and security people in general in a rather awkward
situation. Indeed, this probably scares firewall vendors more than anything
else - the fact that their firewalls are failing because some user or administrator
doesn't fix or upgrade an old version of a potentially vulnerable network
service! I can no longer count the number of times I've heard "I didn't
know leaving sendmail running on my firewall might make it vulnerable."</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>Titan tries to along with using some common sense on
your part, and doing a minimum OS install, to build you a consistent, reproducible
base install.&nbsp; Making the system suitable to then install a firewall
or other product and knowing that the underlying foundation isn't all sand.</font></b>
<h1>
<b><font size=-1>What Titan is not.</font></b></h1>
<a NAME="419162"></a><b><font size=-1>Titan isn't a replacement for anything
(period; end of discussion) Titan doesn't mean you no longer need to install
vendors security patches (although it might save you in some cases if you
didn't install a patch) Titan doesn't mean that you shouldn't install SKIP,
openssh, smap, smrsh, tripwire, Tcp_wrappers, rpcbind, noshell, COPS, SATAN,
TIGER, crack5, cracklib, or any of the other security tools you are (or
should be) currently using but it should make the results of running COPS
look shorter.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>Titan works at the lower OS level to fix common configuration
errors. Things like the user ``lp'' account having a valid shell and some
administrator exporting /var/spool read-write via NFS so users can share
an e-mail server.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>If you can't guess, "/var/spool" is a home directory,
and if user ``lp'' has a valid shell, a remote user can add in a rhosts
entry to /var/spool and login as user ``lp''; oh and guess what? In some
OS's the user ``lp'' is in a privileged group&nbsp; (/etc is mode 775 in
solaris for instance) or owns a directory where root runs commands out
of.</font></b>
<p><a NAME="417940"></a>
<h1>
<b><font size=-1>Why the name Titan?</font></b></h1>
<a NAME="417966"></a><b><font size=-1>I could go off and give the ``its
an acronym'' speech about it standing for ``Toolkit for Interactively Toughening
Advanced Networks and Systems'' but to tell the truth, I just kept getting
requests from my fellow workers at the time (hi Pete, hi Alan) for ``those
scripts to tighten down the OS''. The name just sort of stuck.</font></b>
<p><a NAME="419110"></a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h1>
<b><font size=-1>Some philosophy behind Titan</font></b></h1>
<a NAME="417992"></a><b><font size=-1>Titan was designed using the KISS
module. ``Keep&nbsp; It Simple Stupid''</font></b>
<p><a NAME="417993"></a><b><font size=-1>At one time I built shell scripts
that did all the fixes at one time. The trouble was that sometimes you
wanted some things left alone so you ended up modifying the shell script
(or C program) and commenting out some portions. Then when you went back
to re-use the script the next time it was possible that I forgot that the
script would leave that commented item enabled when *this* time you wanted
it disabled. Thus no consistency.</font></b>
<p><a NAME="418372"></a><b><font size=-1>Or you have the script ask before
doing every change. This can be a pain and time consuming if you need to
do multiple systems and are on a time limit like most of us usually are.
Or want to run things from a crontab.</font></b>
<p><a NAME="417999"></a>
<p><a NAME="418000"></a><b><font size=-1>I abandoned these models in favor
of short succinct set of scripts each of which did -one- and only one specific
type of thing. Script names were picked that (mostly) made reference to
what each module did. I have been hampered by porting to-from filesystems
that restrict file name lengths at times (msdos for instance; ever try
and copy files with names like disable_ip_forwarding.sh to a PC laptop
and then back to a real system? arg!) Thus the names are kept reasonably
short at the expence of loosing a decriptive name.</font></b>

<a NAME="418158"></a>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font size=-1><blink>Install VENDOR patches!!</blink>! It's actually
better to install all known patches <u>before</u> running titan. See the
fix-modes note above. BUT make sure and rerun Titan -V after installing
any vendor patch. It's amazing what things get re-enabled after a patch
run.</font></b></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font size=-1>Use pkgrm to remove packages that can hinder security.
This is pretty dependent on site policy. Some prime candidates might be
any of the compiler stuff and the binary compatibility packages (assuming
this is a firewall). This stops intruders who are lugging around old compiled
binaries from running them on your firewall system. And since you're not
compiling software on your firewall&nbsp; itself (right?) you don't need
to help the opposition compile newer breakin tools.</font></b></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font size=-1>Run COPS and Tiger. We purposly didn't recreate many of
the things that COPS or Tiger checks. Thats not Titan's niche.</font></b></li>
