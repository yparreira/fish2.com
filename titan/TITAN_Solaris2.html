<b>Titan top level directory</b>

<p><a NAME="418052"></a></center>
<a href="Titan-Config">Titan-Config</a> This script&nbsp; figures
out which OS you are using and makes the appropriate links to the shell
scripts accordingly. Titan-Config also asks if you want to&nbsp; make a
backup directory of all files modified by Titan. <blink><font color="#CC0000">NOTE:
</font></blink>backup
(backtit.sh) now backs up /etc/shadow and other important system files.
it is important that these files be kept safe (we chmod them to 600; but
that not enough if titan lives on an NFS mount or other location)
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/Titan">Titan</a>&nbsp; Titan is the
program which runs all the other shell scripts (*.sh) and accepts either
the -I (intro) -F (fix) -C (configuration) [ + filename] )or -V (verify)
flag.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/Titan.top">Titan.top </a>This module
is the same as Titan except the path has been modified so that When "Titan-Config"
is run, Titan can be run from the top most directory.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/TitanReport">TitanReport</a>. This
file runs all Titan modules in the $TITANDIR/bin/modules directory using
the "-v" flag. TitanReport then sends email with&nbsp; the results. Titanreport
is intended to run out of cron, or as an auditing tool. See the<a href="FAQ.html">
FAQ</a> for more.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/sample.Desktop">Sample.Desktop</a>,
<a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/sample.Firewall">sample.Firewall</a>,
<a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/sample.Server">sample.Server</a>,
<a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/sample.config">sample.config.</a>
These files are used as templates when titan is run as "Titan -c config-file".
See the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> for more.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/lib/backtit.sh">backtit.sh </a>This modules
is called by "Titan-Config" when run "Titan-Config -i" (install). Backtit.sh
makes a backup copy of all the files Titan modifies (backtit.sh currently
does not backup file permission changes) SEE Note above!
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/lib/untit.sh">untit.sh</a> Untit.sh is
called by "Titan-Config" when run 'Titan-Config -d" (de-install) Untit.sh
replaces the files modified by Titan with the original unsecured versions,
and is provided as a recovery mechanism if we were too aggressive about
securing the system.
<p><b>src1 directory</b>
<p><a href="../../src1/noshell.c">noshell.c</a> This is the preferred way
of doing a noshell. This should be statically compiled (see <a href="../../src1/makefile">Titan.v4.0/src1/Makefile</a>)
and should replace the shell script that disable-accounts.sh placed in
/usr/sbin/noshell.
<p><a href="../../src1/noshell-simple.c">noshell-simple.c</a> This is a
simplified version of noshell.c . I don't expect this to get much use,
but&nbsp; should be statically compiled (see <a href="../../src1/Makefile">Titan,v4.0/src1/Makefile</a>)
and replace the /usr/sbin/noshell script that disable-accounts.sh creates.
the script that disable-accounts.sh creates is better than nothing,&nbsp;
(better than /bin/true which is also a shell script) but a statically linked
C program is the best way to go.
<p><a href="../../src1/Makefile.linux">Titan,v4.0/src1/Makefile.linux</a>
It turned out that with a few simple changes to the makefile, that noshell
and runas worked fine with Linux distributions (probably other Unix variants
too).
<p><a href="../../src1/runas.c">runas.c</a> This is a simple generic program
that allows administrators to start daemons as non privileged users, and
optionally to run in a chrooted environment. A really good example is the
license manager daemon. Sun sets the license manager daemon (in /etc/rc2.d/S85lmgrd)
to start up with the command (line 84 on my system) :
<p>su nobody -c $lic_srvr_start
<p>This isn't bad, but it requires that the user shell for user "nobody"
be a valid shell. Well being paranoid, Titan sets the shell to "noshell"
so when some intruder tries to login as user "nobody" we get a warning
message. So to get the license manager daemon to start, while keeping our
security intact, we change the /etc/rc2.d/S86lmgrd to use runas with the
following syntax:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; /sbin/runas 60001 60001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 022 $lic_srvr_start
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
^^^^^&nbsp; ^^^^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^^^
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nobodyUID&nbsp;
nobodyGID&nbsp;&nbsp; umask to use
<p>viola! Secure as well as functional. With the latest runas.c you can
also run things in a chrooted environment. This isn't required for the
license manager daemon, but will come in handy for http daemons.
<p>&nbsp;
<p><b>Titan modules (arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules)</b>
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/add-umask.sh">add-umask.sh&nbsp;</a>
Adds system wide umasks for rc?.d files causing system daemon to create
more secure files; (From Casper Dik's code.)
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/adjust-arp-timers.sh">adjust-arp-timers.sh</a>&nbsp;
This changes the system configuration to shorten the ARP expiration timer&nbsp;
to one minute instead of the default 20 minutes.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/adjust.syn-timeout.sh">adjust.syn-timeout.sh&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;
This changes the system configuration to shorten the Abort Time out Value
to ten seconds. Only runs for older versions of Solaris 2.X. Newer versions
have a patch ( 103582-11 currently) which should be applied instead.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/aset.sh">aset.sh</a> This module
was contributed by Jason R. Rhoads mailto:jasonr@net.com. aset.sh is a&nbsp;
Titan wrapper around the Solaris Automated Security Enhancement Tool (ASET)
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/automount.sh">automount.sh&nbsp;</a>
Disables the automounter at boot time. (old version for compatibility)
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/automount2.sh">automount2.sh.</a>
Moves aside the /etc/rc2.d/S74automount file so that automounter doesn't
start up at boot.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/bsm.sh">bsm.sh</a> This module
was contributed by Jason R. Rhoads mailto:jasonr@net.com. bsm.sh verifies
that the Basic Security Module (BSM) is enabled and configures auditing
events by modifying /etc/security/audit_control.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/cde.sh">cde.sh</a> This module
sets up CDE to not allow XDMCP logins from remote.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/create-issue.sh">create.issue.sh</a>
Creates the /etc/issue banner that gets displayed at login time.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/cronset.sh">cronset.sh.</a>
This script check/fixes CRONLOG-YES in /etc/default/cron, rotates the cron
log files at 2Mb, and changes cron permissions.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/decode.sh">decode.sh </a>Looks
for any&nbsp; ``|'' in /etc/aliases and fixes if found.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/defloginparams.sh">defloginparams.sh</a>
Resets the /etc/default/login parameters to a stricter mode.&nbsp; Variables
are in the script to allow you to match <b><i>your</i></b> security policy
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/defpwparams.sh">defpwparams.sh</a>
Resets the /etc/default/password parameters to be stricter. Variables are
in the script to allow you to match <b><i>your</i></b> security
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/disable-L1-A.sh">disable-L1-A.sh
</a>Solaris
2.6 and newer only. This disables the L1-A or stop-A keyboard sequence
by modifying /etc/default/kbd.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/disable-NFS.bind.sh">disable-NFS.bind.sh</a>
Moves the privileged port range to&nbsp; 2050 which thus includes the NFS
ports. This is only needed for solaris 2.5.1 and older. See disable-NFS-2.6.sh
for newer OS systems.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/disable-NFS-2.6.sh">disable-NFS-2.6.sh</a>
This checks that the NFS system port is set as a privileged port. Works
with solaris 2.6 and newer using the new ndd definitions:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ndd /dev/tcp tcp_extra_priv_ports
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ndd /dev/udp udp_extra_priv_ports
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/disable-accounts.sh">disable-accounts.sh</a>
Disables ``system'' accounts like ``bin'' and ``daemon'' and creates a
/usr/sbin/noshell script. The noshell script should only be a place holder
until you compile and install the noshell&nbsp; statically linked C program.
NOTE: if you don't have a root password set, titan WILL disable root as
well.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/disable-core.sh">disable-core.sh</a>
This changed the /etc/system file making the core dump size limited&nbsp;
to zero length. This prevents bad guys forcing a core dump to examine any
information that might be stored in&nbsp; the core image such as /etc/shadow
information.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/disable-ping-echo.sh">disable-ping-echo.sh</a>&nbsp;
This disables ip_respond_to_echo_broadcast so that specific ping crashes
don't work . It also hides the system from some network probe agents that
use broadcast ping to discover hosts to probe.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/disable_ip_holes.sh">disable_ip_holes.sh</a>
Disables ip_forward ip_forward_directed_broadcasts, ip_source_routed,&nbsp;
and ip_ignore_redirect 1, ect..
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/2.6dmi.sh">dmi-2.6.sh</a> Simply
moves aside all the dmi daemons start up files. DMI doesn't do any authentication
; allows core dumps and seems to allow you to start up arbitrary services.
It isn't well documented on what it actually does.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/eeprom.sh">eeprom.sh</a>&nbsp;
Check Only. This checks to see if you set an eeprom password ("eeprom security-mode
= command" is recommended; and then move/remove the eeprom command support
from the kernel) If you don't set a eeprom password, a bad guy might set
one for you (eeprom security-mode = full) and then halt your system. Then
since you don't know the password, you cannot reboot (DOS attack)
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/file-own.sh">file-own.sh</a>
Changes system files (mainly in /usr ) to be owned by "root"." I personally
don't like anything that the root user is going to run not being owned
by root. When /usr/bin is owned by user ``bin'' user ``bin can trojan anything
root runs; thus bin=root. Thus I change everything back to root to begin
with. We need not mention NFS where root=nobody but bin=bin; I think you
get the point.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/fix-cronpath.sh">fix-cronpath.sh</a>
Changes permission and ownership of things run out of roots cron.&nbsp;
Otherwise every time cron is run a new trojan/setuid-root-file could be
created.
<p><a NAME="418095"></a>
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/fix-modes.sh">fix-modes.sh</a>
modes.c modes;&nbsp; (From Casper Dik). Fixes all the mode 775 directories
and binaries and changes the ownership to root where needed. The modes.c&nbsp;
may need&nbsp; to be compiled locally.
<p>- <font color="#FF0000">Big note here!</font> - REMEMBER to <b>re-run
this</b> whenever you add packages or patches!! If you don't, the modes
get brain dead again. This should be run often such as out of cron or at
least after adding any vendor patches.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/fix-stack.sh">fix-stack.sh
</a>wrapper
for Casper Dik's protect_stack which forces all user zero-fill-on-demand
pages are marked rw- instead of rwx. This blocks many of the stack smashing
bugs from working. Note this doesn't work on all versions of the SPARC
architectures (multi processors for instance)
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/fix-stack.sol2.6.sh">fix-stack.sol2.6.sh</a>
Solaris 2.6 has the protect_stack ability built-in as a /etc/system configurable
option. This blocks many of the stack smashing bugs from working.
<p><a href="../..//arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/ftp-2.6_secure.sh">ftp-2.6_secure.sh</a>
This works with Solaris 2.6 and newer version of in.ftpd. It adds in a
umask (UMASK=077) into /etc/default/ftpd, and also
<p>creates a short ftp login warning message by creating /etc/ftp-banner.
There is a size limit imposed on the ftp banner, so if you modify
<p>be cognizant of the length restriction.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Caution</font>
- if you reset the Titan default for UMASK, care should be taken. It is
possible to reset the
<p>umask value to a LESS secure mode (letting ftp create executable binaries
or suid binaries would be a <b>bad</b> thing!)
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/ftpusers.sh">ftpusers.sh</a>
Creates a sane /etc/ftpusers which stops users such as root or "bin" from
using ftp. This prevents "root" from ftping over a new /etc/shadow file,
and forces the administrators to ftp as themselves and then "su" to root
thus keeping the audit trail&nbsp; (more) intact.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/hosts.equiv.sh">hosts.equiv.sh</a>
Checks for /etc/hosts.equiv. it should also check /etc/nsswitch.conf "password
and group" entries but currently doesn't.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/inetd.sh">inetd.sh</a> Changes
/etc/inetd.conf&nbsp; and turns off most of the services.&nbsp; You will
want to&nbsp; localize this.&nbsp; For desktops for instance you might
want to leave on the services for calendar manager and tooltalk (assuming
windows) My suggestion is to get tcp_wrappers and wrap all services. Then
get ssh and turn off rsh/rlogin and ftp and only use ssh/scp for remote
access needs.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/inetd2.sh">inetd2.sh</a> A
more restrictive version of the inetd.sh module. This one turns off everything,
and runs a little cleaner for things like firewalls.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/inetsvc.sh">inetsvc.sh</a>.
This modules changes /etc/init.d/inetsvc to a minimum version such that
named (DNS server), multicast, and DHCP are not supported. Obviously if
you are on a DNS server, or a laptop that uses DHCP, you may not want to
run this module. But for everything else, it helps by not allowing the
system to be bothered by these system calls.
<p><a NAME="418928"></a><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/keyserv.sh">keyserv.sh</a>
Changes the keyserv startup to start keyserv with the "-d" option so that
the default "nobody"&nbsp;&nbsp; key is not allowed.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/lib/is_root">is_root</a> this is not intended
to be run by users. The other scripts call this as a generic check for
execution as root.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/log-tcp.sh">log-tcp.sh
</a>Adds
the "-t" flag to in.inetd startup in /etc/rc2.d/S72inetsvc to trace all
incoming TCP services.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/loginlog.sh">loginlog.sh</a>
Fixes the syntax so that (assuming Sun patches) log entries are made for
failed login attempts.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/lpsched.sh">lpsched.sh</a>
Disables lp. For firewalls, and non-print servers. Probably want to leave
this service on for desktops.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/nddconfig.sh">nddconfig.sh</a>&nbsp;
Creates /etc/rc2.d/<a href="arch/sol2sun4/lib/nddconfig">S70nddconfig</a>
and sets all of the kernel network modules that have to do with security
(that we know of)
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/nfs-portmon.sh">nfs-portmon.sh</a>&nbsp;
Turns on NFS port monitoring for solaris.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/nsswitch.sh">nsswitch.sh</a>&nbsp;
Modifies /etc/nsswitch.conf removing all the nis/nis+/dns entries. This
is useful on a firewall, but you may want to tune it down a little on networked
servers and desktops.&nbsp; It also sets password and group to only look
at local password/group files; again network servers or desktops might
not want this behavior.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/nuke-nscd.sh">nuke-nscd.sh</a>&nbsp;
Disables the Name Service Cache Daemon. Useful on firewalls, but may not
apply to desktops.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/nuke-sendmail.sh">nuke-sendmail.sh</a>
This module does as it implies. Disables sendmail. This modules should
be used on Firewalls that are not sendmail servers, Servers that are not
sendmail servers, and all desktops that have their mail delivered to a
server.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/2.6-pam-rhosts.sh">pam-rhosts-2.6.sh</a>
This solaris 2.6 module saves and modifies the /etc/pam.conf file removing
the line: " rlogin&nbsp; auth sufficient /usr/lib/security/pam_rhosts_auth.so.1"
such that rhosts are not allowed by the PAM system.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/passwd.sh">passwd.sh</a> Checks
that all accounts have passwords and adds in a "*" password if run in fix
mode.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/powerd.sh">powerd.sh</a> Checks
that the power suspend (/usr/openwin/bin/sys-suspend) can only be run by
the root user.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/psfix.sh">psfix.sh</a>&nbsp;
This program creates /etc/rc3.d/S79tmpfix so that upon boot the /tmp&nbsp;
directory will always have the sticky bit set mode 1777
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/rhosts.sh">rhosts.sh</a> Originally
from COPS. Scans for .rhosts in NIS and local directories but unlike COPS
if run in fix mode it removes/renames them.
<p><a NAME="418129"></a><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/rmmount.sh">rmmount.sh</a>
This module adds in the nosuid option into /etc/rmmount.conf forcing vold
to always mount CD's and floppies with the nosuid option enabled. Not needed
if vold.sh has already disabled vold completely.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/rootchk.sh">rootchk.sh</a>
Checks roots path and makes sure that root owns the directories and binaries
in roots path. Changes them (when run -F) if they are wrong. Also removes
the ``.'' from the path.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/routed.sh">routed.sh</a> Starts
in.routed in the quiet mode (-q)
<p>- <font color="#FF0000">Big note here!</font> - REMEMBER to <b>re-run
this</b> whenever you add any patches for in.routed.If you don't, the in.routed
will start up advertising routes again since titans in.routed will be over
written by the patch.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/lib/sanity_check">sanity_check</a> This
isn't meant to be run by users (thus no .sh extension) It is called by
the other scripts to check to make sure scripts are called with at least
one additional argument (-i/-v/-f)
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/sendmail-forward.sh">sendmail-forward.sh</a>
Takes advantage of new sendmail features to disable forwarding of mail
(spammers using you to bounce their mail)
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/sendmail.sh">sendmail.sh</a>
changes sendmail.cf adding in the option ``goaway'' so that telnet hostname
25" (connecting to the sendmail port) doesn't allow cracker to look up
user info.&nbsp; Note- you should also changes the P=/bin/sh to P=/bin/false
if you can or look into using smrsh for servers and desktops. Note-&nbsp;
firewalls should&nbsp; TURN OFF/wrapper&nbsp; sendmail on the firewall
system.&nbsp; Now would be a good time to look into Postfix.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/smtp-banner.sh">smtp-banner.sh</a>
modifies your /etc/mail/sendmail.cf file to hide the OS version you are
running changes the banner from : Sendmail SMI-8.6/SMI-SVR4 ready at Fri,
2 May 1997 to : Sendmail Server Ready
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/smtpbanner-8.8.sh">smtpbanner-8.8.sh
</a>Modified
sendmail version 8.8 sendmail.cf to change the banner to give out less
information.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/2.6snmpdx.sh">snmpdx-2.6.sh</a>
2.6snmpdx.sh Simply moves aside all the snmpdx daemons start up files.
Snmpdx give out more information than you really want it to. Who needs
a port scanner if snmpdx is running?
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/syslog.sh">syslog.sh</a> Modifies
/etc/syslog.conf so that console messages are also saved to system log
files. Note: For critical systems, you should have at least one remote system defined as "loghost" in your /etc/hosts (or NIS/NIS+) so you can do sanity checks to see if your local logs have been changed/deleted by an intruder.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/tcp-sequence.sh">tcp-sequence.sh</a>&nbsp;
Solaris 2.6 and newer. Changes the TCP initial sequence number generation
parameters to use RFC 1948 sequence number generation, unique-per-connection-ID.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/telnet-banner.sh">telnet-banner.sh</a>
This module was contributed by Jason R. Rhoads mailto:jasonr@net.com. telnet-banner.sh&nbsp;
sets BANNER="" in /etc/default/telnetd so that the Solaris version is not
displayed before the login prompt
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/userumask.sh">userumask.sh</a>
Adds in a umask of 022 for users in /etc/skel and /etc files.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/useradd.sh">useraddset.sh</a>&nbsp;
Set up modifications to the default useradd program.
<p><a NAME="418148"></a><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/utmp.sh">utmp.sh</a>
Checks utmp and utmpx just to be sure it isn't world writeable.
<p><a NAME="418150"></a><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/vold.sh">vold.sh</a>&nbsp;
Turns off vold. Vold is not needed on a Firewall and Servers, but might
be left on on desktop systems where users are allowed to mount CD's and
Floppy disks via windowing tools.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/ziplock.sh">ziplock.sh</a>&nbsp;
The final step in tightening - <font color="#FF0000">READ CAREFULLY</font>
-This program absolutely tightens perms for much of the OS. Caution after
this is run ONLY root and group STAFF will be able&nbsp; run many system
functions!!! <b>Not intended to be run on normal systems only those with
strict access rules.</b>
<center>
<p><b>Optional Modules</b>
<p>&nbsp;
<p>This directory contains some specific case modules, where you don't
want or need to run them except in specific configurations. They are put
into the optional directory just so they don't get run by accident.</center>

<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/optional/anon-ftp.setup.sh">anon-ftp.setup.sh&nbsp;</a>
Straight from the Man page for in.ftpd. Sets up Anonymous ftp area in a
reasonable way. This <b>should NOT</b> be used very often, only on systems
that are supposed to allow anonymous ftp.&nbsp; Titan does not run this
by default.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/optional/suid.sh">suid.sh</a> This
is a "check only" module. Run it once, and it will report the number of
setuid binaries on the local file systems. EDIT the script once this number
is known and change "known_suid" variable. On subsequent checks, suid.sh
will check and report any new suid binaries that appear (on local file
systems only). This is meant for audit purposes and possibly for use in
cron. Tripwire is a much better solution, and if suid.sh makes you think
about getting and installing Tripwire then its achieved its purpose.
<p><a href="arch/sol2sun4/bin/modules/wwwchk.sh">wwwchk.sh</a> This
program looks for a WWW (HTTP/HTTPS) server running locally and tries to
validate permissions on any htaccess or other locally defined access control
files. Other areas checked are DocumentRoot, ServerRoot permissions on
any user account access control files e.g.; htaccess In fix mode (-f) changes
will set all files/dirs to owner read/write/execute, group read/execute,
other execute.
